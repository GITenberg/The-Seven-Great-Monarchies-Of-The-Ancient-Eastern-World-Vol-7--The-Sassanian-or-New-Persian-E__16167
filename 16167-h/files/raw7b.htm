    CHAPTER XV.
</h2>
<p>
<i>Reign of Isdigerd II. His War with Rome. His Nine Years' War with the
Ephthalites. His Policy towards Armenia. His Second Ephthalite War. His
Character. His Coins.</i>
</p>
<p>
The successor of Varahan V. was his son, Isdigerd the Second, who
ascended the Persian throne without opposition in the year A.D. 440.
His first act was to declare war against Rome. The Roman forces were,
it would seem, concentrated in the vicinity of Nisibis; and Isdigerd may
have feared that they would make an attack upon the place. He therefore
anticipated them, and invaded the empire with an army composed in part
of his own subjects, but in part also of troops from the surrounding
nations. Saracens, Tzani, Isaurians, and Huns (Ephthalites?) served
under his standard; and a sudden incursion was made into the Roman
territory, for which the imperial officers were wholly unprepared. A
considerable impression would probably have been produced, had not
the weather proved exceedingly unpropitious. Storms of rain and hail
hindered the advance of the Persian troops, and allowed the Roman
generals a breathing space, during which they collected an army. But
the Emperor Theodosius was anxious that the flames of war should not be
relighted in this quarter; and his instructions to the prefect of the
East, the Count Anatolius, were such as speedily led to the conclusion,
first of a truce for a year, and then of a lasting treaty. Anatolius
repaired as ambassador to the Persian camp, on foot and alone, so as to
place himself completely in Isdigerd's power&mdash;an act which so impressed
the latter that (we are told) he at once agreed to make peace on the
terms which Anatolius suggested. The exact nature of these terms is not
recorded; but they contained at least one unusual condition. The
Romans and Persians agreed that neither party should construct any new
fortified post in the vicinity of the other's territory&mdash;a loose phrase
which was likely to be variously interpreted, and might easily lead to
serious complications.
</p>
<p>
It is difficult to understand this sudden conclusion of peace by a young
prince, evidently anxious to reap laurels, who in the first year of
his reign had, at the head of a large army, invaded the dominions of a
neighbor. The Roman account, that he invaded, that he was practically
unopposed, and that then, out of politeness towards the prefect of
the East, he voluntarily retired within his own frontier, "having done
nothing disagreeable," is as improbable a narrative as we often meet
with, even in the pages of the Byzantine historians. Something has
evidently been kept back. If Isdigerd returned, as Procopius declares,
without effecting anything, he must have been recalled by the occurrence
of troubles in some other part of his empire. But it is, perhaps, as
likely that he retired, simply because he had effected the object with
which he engaged in the war. It was a constant practice of the Romans to
advance their frontier by building strong towns on or near a debatable
border, which attracted to them the submission of the neighboring
district. The recent building of Theodosiopolis in the eastern part
of Roman Armenia had been an instance of this practice. It was perhaps
being pursued elsewhere along the Persian border, and the invasion of
Isdigerd may have been intended to check it. If so, the proviso of the
treaty recorded by Procopius would have afforded him the security which
he required, and have rendered it unnecessary for him to continue the
war any longer.
</p>
<p>
His arms shortly afterwards found employment in another quarter. The
Tatars of the Transoxianian regions were once more troublesome; and in
order to check or prevent the incursions which they were always ready
to make, if they were unmolested, Isdigerd undertook a long war on
his northeastern frontier, which he conducted with a resolution
and perseverance not very common in the East. Leaving his vizier,
Mihr-Narses, to represent him at the seat of government, he transferred
his own residence to Nishapm, in the mountain region between the Persian
and Kharesmian deserts, and from that convenient post of observation
directed the military operations against his active enemies, making a
campaign against them regularly every year from A.D. 443 to 451. In the
year last mentioned he crossed the Oxus, and, attacking the Ephthalites
in their own territory, obtained a complete success, driving the monarch
from the cultivated portion of the country, and forcing him to take
refuge in the desert. So complete was his victory that he seems to have
been satisfied with the result, and, regarding the war as terminated, to
have thought the time was come for taking in hand an arduous task, long
contemplated, but not hitherto actually attempted.
</p>
<p>
This was no less a matter than the forcible conversion of Armenia to
the faith of Zoroaster. It has been already noted that the religious
differences which&mdash;from the time when the Armenians, anticipating
Constantine, adopted as the religion of their state and nation the
Christian faith (ab. A.D. 300)&mdash;separated the Armenians from the
Persians, were a cause of weakness to the latter, more especially in
their contests with Rome. Armenia was always, naturally, upon the
Roman side, since a religious sympathy united it with the the court of
Constantinople, and an exactly opposite feeling tended to detach it from
the court of Ctesiphon. The alienation would have been, comparatively
speaking, unimportant, after the division of Armenia between the two
powers, had that division been regarded by either party as final, or as
precluding the formation of designs upon the territory which each had
agreed should be held by the other. But there never yet had been a time
when such designs had ceased to be entertained; and in the war which
Isdigerd had waged with Theodosius at the beginning of his reign,
Roman intrigues in Persarmenia had forced him to send an army into
that country. The Persians felt, and felt with reason, that so long as
Armenia remained Christian and Persia held to the faith of Zoroaster,
the relations of the two countries could never be really friendly;
Persia would always have a traitor in her own camp; and in any time of
difficulty&mdash;especially in any difficulty with Rome&mdash;might look to
see this portion of her territory go over to the enemy. We cannot
be surprised if Persian statesmen were anxious to terminate so
unsatisfactory a state of things, and cast about for a means whereby
Armenia might be won over, and made a real friend instead of a concealed
enemy.
</p>
<p>
The means which suggested itself to Isdigerd as the simplest and most
natural was, as above observed, the conversion of the Armenians to the
Zoroastrian religion. In the early part of his reign he entertained
a hope of effecting his purpose by persuasion, and sent his vizier,
Mihr-Narses, into the country, with orders to use all possible peaceful
means&mdash;gifts, blandishments, promises, threats, removal of malignant
chiefs&mdash;to induce Armenia to consent to a change of religion.
Mihr-Narses did his best, but failed signally. He carried off the chiefs
of the Christian party, not only from Armenia, but from Iberia and
Albania, telling them that Isdigerd required their services against the
Tatars, and forced them with their followers to take part in the Eastern
war. He committed Armenia to the care of the Margrave, Vasag, a
native prince who was well inclined to the Persian cause, and gave
him instructions to bring about the change of religion by a policy of
conciliation. But the Armenians were obstinate. Neither threats,
nor promises, nor persuasions had any effect. It was in vain that
a manifesto was issued, painting the religion of Zoroaster in the
brightest colors, and requiring all persons to conform to it. It was
to no purpose that arrests were made, and punishments threatened. The
Armenians declined to yield either to argument or to menace; and no
progress at all was made in the direction of the desired conversion.
</p>
<p>
In the year A.D. 450, the patriarch Joseph, by the general desire of the
Armenians, held a great assembly, at which it was carried by acclamation
that the Armenians were Christians, and would continue such, whatever it
might cost them. If it was hoped by this to induce Isdigerd to lay aside
his proselytizing schemes, the hope was a delusion. Isdigerd retaliated
by summoning to his presence the principal chiefs, viz., Vasag, the
Margrave; the Sparapet, or commander-in-chief, Vartan, the Mamigonian;
Vazten, prince of Iberia; Vatche, king of Albania, etc.; and having got
them into his power, threatened them with immediate death, unless they
at once renounced Christianity and made profession of Zoroastrianism.
The chiefs, not having the spirit of martyrs, unhappily yielded, and
declared themselves converts; whereupon Isdigerd sent them back to
their respective countries, with orders to force everywhere on their
fellow-countrymen a similar change of religion.
</p>
<p>
Upon this, the Armenians and Iberians broke out in open revolt. Vartan,
the Mamigonian, repenting of his weakness, abjured his new creed,
resumed the profession of Christianity, and made his peace with Joseph,
the patriarch. He then called the people to arms, and in a short time
collected a force of a hundred thousand men. Three armies were formed,
to act separately under different generals. One watched Azerbijan, or
Media Atropatene, whence it was expected that their main attack would be
made by the Persians; another, under Vartan, proceeded to the relief
of Albania, where proceedings were going on similar to those which
had driven Armenia into rebellion; the third, under Vasag, occupied a
central position in Armenia, and was intended to move wherever danger
should threaten. An attempt was at the same time made to induce the
Roman emperor, Marcian, to espouse the cause of the rebels, and send
troops to their assistance; but this attempt was unsuccessful. Marcian
had but recently ascended the throne, and was, perhaps, scarcely fixed
in his seat. He was advanced in years, and naturally unenterprising.
Moreover, the position of affairs in Western Europe was such that
Marcian might expect at any moment to be attacked by an overwhelming
force of northern barbarians, cruel, warlike, and unsparing. Attila was
in A.D. 451 at the height of his power; he had not yet been worsted
at Chalons; and the terrible Huns, whom he led, might in a few months
destroy the Western, and be ready to fall upon the Eastern empire.
Armenia, consequently, was left to her own resources, and had to combat
the Persians single-handed. Even so, she might probably have succeeded,
have maintained her Christianity, or even recovered her independence,
had her people been of one mind, and had no defection from the national
cause manifested itself. But Vasag, the Marzpan, had always been
half-hearted in the quarrel; and, now that the crisis was come, he
determined on going wholly over to the Persians. He was able to carry
with him the army which he commanded; and thus Armenia was divided
against itself; and the chance of victory was well-nigh lost before the
struggle had begun. When the Persians took the field they found half
Armenia ranged upon their side; and, though a long and bloody contest
followed, the end was certain from the beginning. After much desultory
warfare, a great battle was fought in the sixteenth year of Isdigerd
(A.D. 455 or 456) between the Christian Armenians on the one side, and
the Persians, with their Armenian abettors, on the other. The Persians
were victorious; Vartan, and his brother, Hemaiiag, were among the
slain; and the patriotic party found that no further resistance was
possible. The patriarch, Joseph, and the other bishops, were seized,
carried off to Persia, and martyred. Zoroastrianism was enforced upon
the Armenian nation. All accepted it, except a few, who either took
refuge in the dominions of Rome, or fled to the mountain fastnesses of
Kurdistan.
</p>
<p>
The resistance of Armenia was scarcely overborne, when war once more
broke out in the East, and Isdigerd was forced to turn his attention
to the defence of his frontier against the aggressive Ephthalites, who,
after remaining quiet for three or four years, had again flown to arms,
had crossed the Oxus, and invaded Khorassan in force. On his first
advance the Persian monarch was so far successful that the invading
hordes seems to have retired, and left Persia to itself; but when
Isdigerd, having resolved to retaliate, led his own forces into the
Ephthalite country, they took heart, resisted him, and, having tempted
him into an ambuscade, succeeded in inflicting upon him a severe defeat.
Isdigerd was forced to retire hastily within his own borders, and to
leave the honors of victory to his assailants, whose triumph must have
encouraged them to continue year after year their destructive inroads
into the north-eastern provinces of the empire.
</p>
<p>
It was not long after the defeat which he suffered in this quarter that
Isdigerd's reign came to an end. He died A.D. 457, after having held the
throne for seventeen or (according to some) for nineteen years. He was
a prince of considerable ability, determination, and courage. That his
subjects called him "the Clement" is at first sight surprising, since
clemency is certainly not the virtue that any modern writer would think
of associating with his name. But we may assume from the application of
the term that, where religious considerations did not come into play,
he was fair and equitable, mild-tempered, and disinclined to harsh
punishments. Unfortunately, experience tells us that natural mildness
is no security against the acceptance of a bigot's creed; and, when a
policy of persecution has once been adopted, a Trajan or a Valerian will
be as unsparing as a Maximin or a Galerius. Isdigerd was a bitter and
successful persecutor of Christianity, which he&mdash;for a time at any
rate&mdash;stamped out, both from his own proper dominions, and from the
newly-acquired province of Armenia. He would have preferred less violent
means; but, when they failed, he felt no scruples in employing the
extremest and severest coercion. He was determined on uniformity; and
uniformity he secured, but at the cost of crushing a people, and so
alienating them as to make it certain that they would, on the first
convenient occasion, throw off the Persian yoke altogether.
</p>
<p>
The coins of Isdigerd II. nearly resemble those of his father, Varahran
V., differing only in the legend, and in the fact that the mural crown
of Isdigerd is complete. The legend is remarkably short, being either
<i>Masdisn kadi Tezdikerti</i>, or merely <i>Kadi Yezdikerti</i>&mdash;i.e. "the
Ormazd-worshipping great Isdigerd;" or "Isdigord the Great." The
coins are not very numerous, and have three mint-marks only, which are
interpreted to mean "Khuzistan," "Ctesiphon," and "Nehavend." <a href="#image-0002">[PLATE

</p>
<p>
On the death of Isdigerd II. (A.D. 457) the throne was seized by his
younger son Hormisdas, who appears to have owed his elevation, in a
great measure, to the partiality of his father. That monarch, preferring
his younger son above his elder, had made the latter governor of the
distant Seistan, and had thus removed him far from the court, while he
retained Hormisdas about his own person. The advantage thus secured to
Hormisdas enabled him when his father died to make himself king; and
Perozes was forced, we are told, to fly the country, and place himself
under the protection of the Ephthalite monarch, who ruled in the valley
of the Oxus, over Bactria, Tokaristan, Badakshan, and other neighboring
districts. This king, who bore the name of Khush-newaz, received him
favorably, and though at first, out of fear for the power of Persia, he
declined to lend him troops, was induced after a while to adopt a bolder
policy. Hormisdas, despite his epithet of Ferzan, "the Wise," was soon
at variance with his subjects, many of whom gathered about Perozes
at the court which he was allowed to maintain in Taleqan, one of
the Ephthalite cities. Supported by this body of refugees, and by an
Ephthalite contingent, Perozes ventured to advance against his brother.
His army, which was commanded by a certain Raham, or Ram, a noble of the
Mihran family, attacked the forces of Hormisdas, defeated them, and
made Hormisdas himself a prisoner. The troops of the defeated monarch,
convinced by the logic of success, deserted their late leader's cause,
and went over in a body to the conqueror. Perozes, after somewhat more
than two years of exile, was acknowledged as king by the whole Persian
people, and, quitting Taleqan, established himself at Ctesiphon, or
Al Modain, which had now become the main seat of government. It is
uncertain what became of Hormisdas. According to the Armenian writers,
Raham, after defeating him, caused him to be put to death; but the
native historian, Mirkhond, declares that, on the contrary, Perozes
forgave him for having disputed the succession, and amiably spared his
life.
</p>
<p>
The civil war between the two brothers, short as it was, had lasted long
enough to cost Persia a province. Vatche, king of Aghouank (Albania)
took advantage of the time of disturbance to throw off his allegiance,
and succeeded in making himself independent. It was the first object
of Perozes, after establishing himself upon the throne, to recover this
valuable territory. He therefore made war upon Vatche, thought that
prince was the son of his sister, and with the help of his Ephthalite
allies, and of a body of Alans whom he took into his service, defeated
the rebellious Albanians and completely subjugated the revolted country.
</p>
<p>
A time of prosperity now ensued. Perozes ruled with moderation and
justice. He dismissed his Ephthalite allies with presents that amply
contented them, and lived for five years in great peace and honor. But
in the seventh year, from the death of his father, the prosperity of
Persia was suddenly and grievously interrupted by a terrible drought,
a calamity whereto Asia has in all ages been subject, and which often
produces the most frightful consequences. The crops fail; the earth
becomes parched and burnt up; smiling districts are change into
wildernesses; fountains and brooks cease to flow; then the wells have no
water; finally even the great rivers are reduced to threads, and contain
only the scantiest supply of the life-giving fluid in their channels.
Famine under these circumstances of necessity sets in; the poor die by
hundreds; even the rich have a difficulty in sustaining life by means of
food imported from a distance. We are told that the drought in the reign
of Perozes was such that at last there was not a drop of water either in
the Tigris or the Oxus; all the sources and fountains, all the streams
and brooks failed; vegetation altogether ceased; the beasts of the field
and the fowls of the air perished; nowhere through the whole empire
was a bird to be seen; the wild animals, even the reptiles, disappeared
altogether. The dreadful calamity lasted for seven years, and under
ordinary circumstances the bulk of the population would have been
swept off; but such were the "wisdom and the beneficence of the Persian
monarch," that during the entire duration of the scourge not a single
person, or, according to another account, but one person, perished of
hunger. Perozes began by issuing general orders that the rich should
come to the relief of their poorer brethren; he required the governors
of towns, and the head-men of villages, to see that food was supplied
to those in need, and threatened that for each poor man in a town or
village who died of want he would put a rich man to death. At the end of
two years, finding that the drought continued, he declined to take any
revenue from his subjects, remitting taxes of all kinds, whether they
were money imposts or contributions in kind. In the fourth year, not
content with these measures, he went further: opened the treasury doors
and made distributions of money from his own stores to those in need. At
the same time he imported corn from Greece, from India, from the valley
of the Oxus, and from Abyssinia, obtaining by these means such ample
supplies that he was able to furnish an adequate sustenance to all his
subjects. The result was that not only did the famine cause no mortality
among the poorer classes, but no one was even driven to quit the country
in order to escape the pressure of the calamity.
</p>
<p>
Such is the account which is given by the Oriental authors of the
terrible famine which they ascribe to the early part of the reign of
Perozes. It is difficult, however, to suppose that the matter has not
been very much exaggerated, since we find that, as early as A.D. 464-5,
when the famine should have been at its height, Perozes had entered upon
a great war and was hotly engaged in it, his ambassadors at the same
time being sent to the Greek court, not to ask supplies of food, but to
request a subsidy on account of his military operations. The enemy which
had provoked his hostility was the powerful nation of the Ephthalites,
by whose aid he had so recently obtained the Persian crown. According to
a contemporary Greek authority, more worthy of trust than most writers
of his age and nation, the origin of the war was a refusal on the part
of the Ephthalites to make certain customary payments which the Persians
viewed in the light of a tribute. Perozes determined to enforce his just
rights, and marched his troops against the defaulters with this object.
But in his first operations he was unsuccessful, and after a time he
thought it best to conclude the war, and content himself with taking a
secret revenge upon his enemy, by means of an occult insult. He proposed
to Khush-newaz to conclude a treaty of peace, and to strengthen the
compact by adding to it a matrimonial alliance. Khush-newaz should take
to wife one of his daughters, and thus unite the interests of the two
reigning families. The proposal was accepted by the Ephthalite monarch;
and he readily espoused the young lady who was sent to his court
apparelled as became a daughter of Persia. In a little time, however, he
found that he had been tricked: Perozes had not sent him his daughter,
but one of his female slaves; and the royal race of the Ephthalite
kings had been disgraced by a matrimonial union with a person of
servile condition. Khush-newaz was justly indignant; but dissembled his
feelings, and resolved to repay guile with guile. He wrote to Perozes
that it was his intention to make war upon a neighboring tribe, and that
he wanted officers of experience to conduct the military operations. The
Persian monarch, suspecting nothing, complied with the request, and
sent three hundred of his chief officers to Khush-newaz, who immediately
seized them, put some to death, and, mutilating the remainder, commanded
them to return to their sovereign, and inform him that the king of the
Ephthalites now felt that he had sufficiently avenged the trick of which
he had been the victim. On receiving this message Perozes renewed
the war, advanced towards the Ephthalite country, and fixed his
head-quarters in Hyrcania, at the city of Gurgan, He was accompanied by
a Greek of the name of Eusebius, an ambassador from the Emperor Zeno,
who took back to Constantinople the following account of the campaign.
</p>
<p>
When Perozes, having invaded the Ephthalite territory, fell in with the
army of the enemy, the latter pretended to be seized with a panic, and
at once took to flight. The retreat was directed upon a portion of the
mountain region, where a broad and good road led into a spacious
plain, surrounded on all sides by wooded hills, steep and in places
precipitous. Here the mass of the Ephthalite troops was cunningly
concealed amid the foliage of the woods, while a small number,
remaining visible, led the Persians into the cul-de-sac, the whole army
unsuspectingly entering, and only learning their danger when they saw
the road whereby they had entered blocked up by the troops from the
hills. The officers then apprehended the true state of the case, and
perceived that they had been cleverly entrapped; but none of them, it
would seem, dared to inform the monarch that he had been deceived by
a stratagem. Application was made to Eusebius, whose ambassadorial
character would protect him from an outbreak, and he was requested to
let Perozes know how he was situated, and exhort him to endeavor to
extricate himself by counsel rather than by a desperate act. Eusebius
upon this employed the Oriental method of apologue, relating to Perozes
how a lion in pursuit of a goat got himself into difficulties, from
which all his strength could not enable him to make his escape. Perozes
apprehended his meaning, understood the situation, and, desisting from
the pursuit, prepared to give battle where he stood. But the Ephthalite
monarch had no wish to push matters to extremities. Instead of falling
on the Persians from every side, he sent an embassy to Perozes and
offered to release him from his perilous situation, and allow him to
return with all his troops to Persia, if he would swear a perpetual
peace with the Ephthalites and do homage to himself as his lord and
master, by prostration. Perozes felt that he had no choice but to accept
these terms, hard as he might think them. Instructed by the Magi, he
made the required prostration at the moment of sunrise, with his face
turned to the east, and thought thus to escape the humiliation of
abasing himself before a mortal by the mental reservation that the
intention of his act was to adore the great Persian divinity. He then
swore to the peace, and was allowed to return with his army intact into
Persia.
</p>
<p>
It seems to have been soon after the conclusion of his disgraceful
treaty that serious troubles once more broke out in Armenia. Perozes,
following out the policy of his father, Isdigerd, incessantly persecuted
the Christians of his northern provinces, especially those of Armenia,
Georgia, and Albania. So severe were his measures that vast numbers of
the Armenians quitted their country, and, placing themselves under the
protection of the Greek Emperor, became his subjects, and entered into
his service. Armenia was governed by Persian officials, and by apostate
natives who treated their Christian fellow-countrymen with extreme
rudeness, insolence, and injustice. Their efforts were especially
directed against the few noble families who still clung to the faith
of Christ, and had not chosen to expatriate themselves. Among these the
most important was that of the Mamigonians, long celebrated in Armenian
history, and at this time reckoned chief among the nobility. The
renegades sought to discredit this family with the Persians; and Vahan,
son of Hemaiiag, its head, found himself compelled to visit, once and
again, the court of Persia, in order to meet the charges of his enemies
and counteract the effect of their calumnies. Successful in vindicating
himself, and received into high favor by Perozes, he allowed the
sunshine of prosperity to extort from him what he had guarded firmly
against all the blasts of persecution&mdash;to please his sovereign, he
formally abjured the Christian faith, and professed himself a disciple
of Zoroaster. The triumph of the anti-Christian party seemed now
secured; but exactly at this point a reaction set in. Vahan became a
prey to remorse, returned secretly to his old creed and longed for an
opportunity of wiping out the shame of his apostasy by perilling his
life for the Christian cause. The opportunity was not long in presenting
itself. In A.D. 481 Perozes suffered a defeat at the hand of the
barbarous Koushans, who held at this time the low Caspian tract
extending from Asterabad to Derbend. Iberia at once revolted, slew its
Zoroastrian king, Vazken, and placed a Christian, Vakhtang, upon the
throne. The Persian governor of Armenia, having received orders to quell
the Iberian rebellion, marched with all the troops that he could muster
into the northern province, and left the Armenians free to follow their
own devices. A rising immediately took place. Vahan at first endeavored
to check the movement, being doubtful of the power of Armenia to cope
with Persia, and feeling sure that the aid of the Greek emperor could
not be counted on. But the the popular enthusiasm overleaped all
resistance; everywhere the Christian party rushed to arms, and swore
to free itself; the Persians with their adherents fled the country;
Artaxata, the capital, was besieged and taken; the Christians were
completely victorious, and, having made themselves masters of all
Persarmenia, proceeded to establish a national government, placing at
their head as king, Sahag, the Bagratide, and appointing Vahan, the
Mamigonian, to be Sparapet, or "Commander-in-Chief."
</p>
<p>
Intelligence of these events recalled the Persian governor,
Ader-Veshnasp, from Iberia. Returning into his province at the head
of an army of no great size, composed of Atropatenians, Medes, and
Cadusians, he was encountered by Vasag, a brother of Vahan, on the river
Araxes, with a small force, and was completely defeated and slain.
</p>
<p>
Thus ended the campaign of A.D. 481. In A.D. 482 the Persians made a
vigorous attempt to recover their lost ground by sending two armies,
one under Ader-Nerseh against Armenia, and the other under Mihran into
Iberia. Vahan met the army of Ader-Nerseh in the plain of Ardaz, engaged
it, and defeated it after a sharp struggle, in which the king, Sahag,
particularly distinguished himself. Mihran was opposed by Vakhtang,
the Iberian king, who, however, soon found himself overmatched, and was
forced to apply to Armenia for assistance. The Armenians came to his aid
in full force; but their generosity was ill rewarded. Vakhtang plotted
to make his peace with Persia by treacherously betraying his allies into
their enemies' hands; and the Armenians, forced to fight at tremendous
disadvantage, suffered a severe defeat. Sahag, the king, and Vasag, one
of the brothers of Vahan, were slain; Vahan himself escaped, but at the
head of only a few followers, with whom he fled to the highland district
of Daik, on the borders of Home and Iberia. Here he was "hunted upon
the mountains" by Mihran, and would probably have been forced to succumb
before the year was out, had not the Persian general suddenly received
a summons from his sovereign, who needed his aid against the Roushans
of the low Caspian region. Mihran, compelled to obey this call, had to
evacuate Armenia, and Vahan in a few weeks recovered possession of the
whole country.
</p>
<p>
The year A.D. 483 now arrived, and another desperate attempt was made
to crush the Armenian revolt. Early in the spring a Persian army invaded
Armenia, under a general called Hazaravougd. Vahan allowed himself to be
surprised, to be shut up in the city of Dovin, and to be there besieged.
After a while he made his escape, and renewed the guerilla warfare in
which he was an adept; but the Persians recovered most of the country,
and he was himself, on more than one occasion, driven across the border
and obliged to seek refuge in Roman Armenia, whither his adversary
had no right to follow him. Even here, however, he was not safe.
Hazaravougd, at the risk of a rupture with Rome, pursued his flying foe
across the frontier; and Vahan was for some time in the greatest danger.
But the Persian system of constantly changing the commands of their
chief officers saved him. Hazaravougd received orders from the court to
deliver up Armenia to a newly appointed governor, named Sapor, and to
direct his own efforts to the recovery of Iberia, which was still
in insurrection. In this latter enterprise he was successful; Iberia
submitted to him; and Vakhtang fled to Colchis. But in Armenia the
substitution of Sapor for Hazaravougd led to disaster. After a vain
attempt to procure the assassination of Vahan by two of his officers,
whose wives were Roman prisoners, Sapor moved against him with a strong
body of troops; but the brave Mamigonian, falling upon his assailant
unawares, defeated him with great loss, and dispersed his army. A second
battle was fought with a similar result; and the Persian force, being
demoralized, had to retreat; while Vajian, taking the offensive,
established himself in Dovin, and once more rallied to his side the
great mass of the nation. Affairs were in this state, when suddenly
there arrived from the east intelligence of the most supreme importance,
which produced a pause in the Armenian conflict and led to the placing
of Armenian affairs on a new footing.
</p>
<p>
Perozes had, from the conclusion of his treaty with the Ephthalite
monarch (ab. A.D. 470), been tormented with the feeling that he had
suffered degradation and disgrace. He had, perhaps, plunged into the
Armenian and other wars in the hope of drowning the recollection of his
shame, in his own mind as well as in the minds of others. But fortune
had not greatly smiled on him in these struggles; and any credit that
he obtained from them was quite insufficient to produce forgetfulness
of his great disaster. Hence, as time went on, he became more and more
anxious to wipe out the memory of the past by a great and signal victory
over his conquerors. He therefore after some years determined to renew
the war. It was in vain that the chief Mobed opposed himself to this
intention; it was in vain that his other counsellors sought to dissuade
him, that his general, Bahram, declared against the infraction of the
treaty, and that the soldiers showed themselves reluctant to fight.
Perozes had resolved, and was not to be turned from his resolution. He
collected from all parts of the empire a veteran force, amounting, it
is said, 50 to 100,000 men, and 500 elephants, placed the direction of
affairs at the court in the hands of Balas (Palash), his son or brother,
and then marched upon the north-eastern frontier, with the determination
to attack and defeat the Ephthalites or perish in the attempt. According
to some Oriental writers he endeavored to escape the charge of having
falsified his engagements by a curious subterfuge. The exact terms of
his oath to Khush-newaz, the Ephthalite king, had been that he would
never march his forces past a certain pillar which that monarch had
erected to mark the boundary line between the Persian and Ephthalite
dominions. Perozes persuaded himself that he would sufficiently observe
his engagement if he kept its letter; and accordingly he lowered
the pillar, and placed it upon a number of cars, which were attached
together and drawn by a train of fifty elephants, in front of his army.
Thus, however deeply he invaded the Ephthalite country, he never "passed
beyond" the pillar which he had sworn not to pass. In his own judgment
he kept his vow, but not in that of his natural advisers. It is
satisfactory to find that the Zoroastrian priesthood, speaking by the
mouth of the chief Mobed, disclaimed and exposed the fallacy of this
wretched casuistry.
</p>
<p>
The Ephthalite monarch, on learning the intention of Perozes, prepared
to meet his attack by stratagem. He had taken up his position in the
plain near Balkh, and had there established his camp, resolved to await
the coming of the enemy. During the interval he proceeded to dig a deep
and broad trench in front of his whole position, leaving only a space
of some twenty or thirty yards, midway in the work, untouched. Having
excavated the trench, he caused it to be filled with water, and
covered carefully with boughs of trees, reeds, and earth, so as to be
undistinguishable from the general surface of the plain on which he was
encamped. On the arrival of the Persians in his front, he first of all
held a parley with Perozes, in which, after reproaching him with his
ingratitude and breach of faith, he concluded by offering to renew the
peace. Perozes scornfully refused; whereupon the Ephthalite prince hung
on the point of a lance the broken treaty, and, parading it in front of
the Persian troops, exhorted them to avoid the vengeance which was sure
to fall on the perjured by deserting their doomed monarch. Upon this,
half the army, we are told, retired; and Khush-newaz proceeded to effect
the destruction of the remainder by means of the plan which he had so
carefully prepared beforehand. He sent a portion of his troops across
the ditch, with orders to challenge the Persians to an engagement, and,
when the fight began, to fly hastily, and, returning within the ditch
by the sound passage, unite themselves with the main army. The entire
Persian host, as he expected, pursued the fugitives, and coming unawares
upon the concealed trench plunged into it, was inextricably entangled,
and easily destroyed. Perozes himself, several of his sons, and most of
his army perished. Mruz-docht, his daughter, the chief Mobed, and great
numbers of the rank and file were made prisoners. A vast booty was
taken. Khush-newaz did not tarnish the glory of his victory by any
cruelties; he treated the captives tenderly, and caused search to be
made for the body of Perozes, which was found and honorably interred.
</p>
<p>
Thus perished Perozes, after a reign of (probably) twenty-six years.
He was undoubtedly a brave prince, and entitled to the epithet of Al
Merdaneh, "the Courageous," which he received from his subjects. But
his bravery, unfortunately, verged upon rashness, and was unaccompanied
(so far as appears) by any other military quality. Perozes had neither
the sagacity to form a good plan of campaign, nor the ability to conduct
a battle. In all the wars wherein he was personally engaged he was
unsuccessful, and the only triumphs which gilded his arms wore gained by
his generals. In his civil administration, on the contrary, he obtained
a character for humanity and justice; and, if the Oriental accounts
of his proceedings during the great famine are to be regarded as
trustworthy, we must admit that his wisdom and benevolence were such as
are not commonly found in those who bear rule in the East. His conduct
towards Khush-newaz has generally been regarded as the great blot upon
his good fame; and it is certainly impossible to justify the paltry
casuistry by which he endeavored to reconcile his actions with his words
at the time of his second invasion. But his persistent hostility towards
the Ephthalites is far from inexcusable, and its motive may have been
patriotic rather than personal. He probably felt that the Ephthalite
power was among those from which Persia had most to fear, and that it
would have been weak in him to allow gratitude for a favor conferred
upon himself to tie his hands in a matter where the interests of his
country were vitally concerned. The Ephthalites continued for nearly a
century more to be among the most dangerous of her neighbors to Persia;
and it was only by frequent attacks upon them in their own homes
that Persia could reasonably hope to ward off their ravages from her
territory.
</p>
<p>
It is doubtful whether we possess any coins of Hormisdas III., the
brother and predecessor of Perozes. Those which are assigned to him by
Mordtmann bear a name which has no resemblance to his; and those bearing
the name of Ram, which Mr. Taylor considers to be coins of Hormisdas,
cannot have been issued under his authority, since Ram was the
guardian and general, not of Hormisdas, but of his brother. Perhaps the
remarkable specimen figured by M. Longperier in his valuable work, which
shows a bull's head in place of the usual inflated ball, may really
belong to this prince. The legend upon it is read without any doubt
as Auhrimazd, or "Hormisdas;" and in general character it is certainly
Sassanian, and of about this period. <a href="#image-0002">[PLATE XXI., Fig. 5.]</a>
</p>
<p>
The coins of Perozes are undoubted, and are very numerous. They are
distinguished generally by the addition to the ordinary crown of two
wings, one in front of the crown, and the other behind it, and bear the
legend, <i>Kadi Piruzi</i>, or <i>Mazdisn Kadi Piruzi</i>, i.e., "King Perozes,"
or "the Ormazd-worshipping king Perozes." The earring of the monarch
is a triple pendant. On the reverse, besides the usual fire-altar
and supporters, we see on either side of the altar-flame a star and
a crescent. The legend here is M&mdash;probably for malka, "king"&mdash;or
else Kadi, together with a mint-mark. The mints named are numerous,
comprising (according to Mordtmann) Persepolis, Ispahan, Rhages,
Nehavend, Darabgherd, Zadracarta, Nissa, Behistun, Chuzistan, Media,
Kerman, and Azerbijan; or (according to Mr. Thomas) Persepolis, Rasht,
Nehavend, Darabgherd, Baiza, Modai'n, Merv, Shiz, Iran, Kerman, Yezd,
and fifteen others. The general character of the coinage is rude and
coarse, the reverse of the coins showing especial signs of degradation.
<a href="#image-0002">[PLATE XXI., Fig. 6.]</a>
</p>
<p>
Besides his coins, one other memorial of the reign of Perozes has
escaped the ravages of time. This is a cup or vase, of antique and
elegant form, engraved with a hunting-scene, which has been thus
described by a recent writer: "This cup, which comes from Russia, has
a diameter of thirty-one centimetres, and is shaped like a ewer without
handles. At the bottom there stands out in relief the figure of a
monarch on horseback, pursuing at full speed various wild animals;
before him fly a wild boar and wild sow, together with their young, an
ibex, an antelope, and a buffalo. Two other boars, an ibex, a buffalo,
and an antelope are strewn on the ground, pierced with arrows. The king
has an aquiline nose, an eye which is very wide open, a short beard,
horizontal moustaches of considerable length, the hair gathered behind
the head in quite a small knot, and the ear ornamented with a double
pendant, pear-shaped; the head of the monarch supports a crown, which
is mural at the side and back, while it bears a crescent in front; two
wings surmounting a globe within a crescent form the upper part of the
head-dress. On his right the king carries a short dagger and a quiver
full of arrows, on his left a sword. Firuz, who has the finger-guard
of an archer on his right hand, is represented in the act of bending a
large bow made of horn." There would seem to be no doubt that the work
thus described is rightly assigned to Perozes.

</p>
<p>
Perozes was succeeded by a prince whom the Greeks call Balas, the Arabs
and later Persians Palash, but whose real name appears to have been
Valakhesh or Volagases. Different accounts are given of his relationship
to his predecessor, the native writers unanimously representing him
as the son of Perozes and brother of Kobad, while the Greeks and the
contemporary Armenians declare with one voice that he was Kobad's uncle
and Perozes's brother. It seems on the whole most probable that the
Greeks and Armenians are right and we may suppose that Perozes, having
no son whom he could trust to take his place when he quitted his capital
in order to take the management of the Ephthalite war, put the regency
and the guardianship of his children into the hands of his brother,
Valakhesh, who thus, not unnaturally, became king when it was found that
Perozes had fallen.
</p>
<p>
The first efforts of the new monarch were of necessity directed towards
an arrangement with the Ephthalites, whose signal victory over Perozes
had laid the north-eastern frontier of Persia open to their attack.
Balas, we are told, employed on this service the arms and arts of
an officer named Sukhra or Sufraii, who was at the time governor of
Seistan. Sukhra collected an imposing force, and conducted it to the
Ephthalite border, where he alarmed Khush-newaz by a display of his own
skill with the bow. He then entered into negotiations and obtained the
release of Firuz-docht, of the Grand Mobed, and of the other important
prisoners, together with the restoration of a large portion of the
captured booty, but was probably compelled to accept on the part of his
sovereign some humiliating conditions. Procopius informs us that, in
consequence of the defeat of Perozes, Persia became subject to the
Ephthalites and paid them tribute for two years; and this is so probable
a result, and one so likely to have been concealed by the native
writers, that his authority must be regarded as outweighing the silence
of Mirkhond and Tabari. Balas, we must suppose, consented to become an
Ephthalite tributary, rather than renew the war which had proved fatal
to his brother. If he accepted this position, we can well understand
that Khush-newaz would grant him the small concessions of which the
Persian writers boast; while otherwise the restoration of the booty and
the prisoners without a battle is quite inconceivable.
</p>
<p>
Secure, so long as he fulfilled his engagements, from any molestation in
this quarter, Balas was able to turn his attention to the north-western
portion of his dominions, and address himself to the difficult task of
pacifying Armenia, and bringing to an end the troubles which had now
for several years afflicted that unhappy province. His first step was
to nominate as Marzpan, or governor, of Armenia, a Persian who bore
the name of Nikhor, a man eminent for justice and moderation. Nikhor,
instead of attacking Vahan, who held almost the whole of the country,
since the Persian troops had been withdrawn on the news of the death
of Perozes, proposed to the Armenian prince that they should discuss
amicably the terms upon which his nation would be content to end the war
and resume its old position of dependence upon Persia. Vahan expressed
his willingness to terminate the struggle by an arrangement, and
suggested the following as the terms on which he and his adherents would
be willing to lay down their arms:
</p>
<p>
(1) The existing fire-altars should be destroyed, and no others should
be erected in Armenia.
</p>
<p>
(2) The Armenians should be allowed the full and free exercise of the
Christian religion, and no Armenians should be in future tempted or
bribed to declare themselves disciples of Zoroaster.
</p>
<p>
(3) If converts were nevertheless made from Christianity to
Zoroastrianism, places should not be given to them.
</p>
<p>
(4) The Persian king should in person, and not by deputy, administer the
affairs of Armenia. Nikhor expressed himself favorable to the acceptance
of these terms; and, after an exchange of hostages, Vahan visited his
camp and made arrangements with him for the solemn ratification of peace
on the aforesaid conditions. An edict of toleration was issued, and it
was formally declared that "every one should be at liberty to adhere to
his own religion, and that no one should be driven to apostatize." Upon
these terms peace was concluded between Vahan and Nikhor, and it was
only necessary that the Persian monarch should ratify the terms for them
to become formally binding.
</p>
<p>
While matters were in this state, and the consent of Balas to the
terms agreed upon had not yet been positively signified, an important
revolution took place at the court of Persia. Zareh, a son of Perozes,
preferred a claim to the crown, and was supported in his attempt by a
considerable section of the people. A civil war followed; and among the
officers employed to suppress it was Nikhor, the governor of Armenia. On
his appointment he suggested to Vahan that it would lend great force to
the Armenian claims if under the existing circumstances the Armenians
would furnish effective aid to Balas, and so enable him to suppress the
rebellion. Vahan saw the importance of the conjuncture, and immediately
sent to Nikhor's aid a powerful body of cavalry under the command of his
own nephew, Gregory. Zareh was defeated, mainly in consequence of the
great valor and excellent conduct of the Armenian contingent. He fled
to the mountains, but was pursued, and was very shortly afterwards made
prisoner and slain.
</p>
<p>
Soon after this, Kobad, son of Perozes, regarding the crown as
rightfully his, put forward a claim to it, but, meeting with no success,
was compelled to quit Persia and throw himself upon the kind protection
of the Ephthalites, who were always glad to count among their refugees a
Persian pretender. The Ephthalites, however, made no immediate stir&mdash;it
would seem, that so long as Balas paid his tribute they were content,
and felt no inclination to disturb what seemed to them a satisfactory
arrangement.
</p>
<p>
The death of Zareh and the flight of Kobad left Balas at liberty to
resume the work which their rebellions had interrupted&mdash;the complete
pacification of Armenia. Knowing how much depended upon Vahan, he
summoned him to his court, received him with the highest honors,
listened attentively to his representations, and finally agreed to the
terms which Vahan had formulated. At the same time he replaced Nikhor
by a governor named Antegan, a worthy successor, "mild, prudent, and
equitable;" and, to show his confidence in the Mamigonian prince,
appointed him to the high office of Commander-in-Chief, or "Sparapet."
This arrangement did not, however, last long. Antegan, after ruling
Armenia for a few months, represented to his royal master that it would
be the wisest course to entrust Vahan with the government, that the same
head which had conceived the terms of the pacification might watch over
and ensure their execution. Antegan's recommendation approved itself
to the Persian monarch, who proceeded to recall his self-denying
councillor, and to install Vahan in the vacant office. The post of
Sparapet was assigned to Vart, Vahan's brother. Christianity was then
formally reestablished as the State religion of Armenia; the fire-altars
were destroyed; the churches reclaimed and purified; the hierarchy
restored to its former position and powers. A reconversion of almost
the whole nation to the Christian faith was the immediate result; the
apostate Armenians recanted their errors, and abjured Zoroastrianism;
Armenia, and with it Iberia, were pacified; and the two provinces which
had been so long a cause of weakness to Persia grew rapidly into main
sources of her strength and prosperity.
</p>
<p>
The new arrangement had not been long completed when Balas died (A.D.
487). It is agreed on all hands that he held the throne for no more than
four years, and generally allowed that he died peaceably by a natural
death. He was a wise and just prince, mild in his temper, averse to
military enterprises, and inclined to expect better results from pacific
arrangements than from wars and expeditions. His internal administration
of the empire gave general satisfaction to his subjects; he protected
and relieved the poor, extended cultivation, and punished governors who
allowed any men in their province to fall into indigence. His prudence
and moderation are especially conspicuous in his arrangement of the
Armenian difficulty, whereby he healed a chronic sore that had long
drained, the resources of his country. His submission to pay tribute
to the Ephthalites may be thought to indicate a want of courage or
of patriotism; but there are times when the purchase of a peace is
a necessity; and it is not clear that Balas was minded to bear the
obligation imposed on him a moment longer than was necessary. The
writers who record the fact that Persia submitted for a time to pay a
tribute limit the interval during which the obligation held to a couple
of years. It would seem, therefore, that Balas, who reigned four years,
must, a year at least before his demise, have shaken off the Ephthalite
yoke and ceased to make any acknowledgment of dependence. Probably it
was owing to the new attitude assumed by him that the Ephthalites,
after refusing to give Kobad any material support for the space of three
years, adopted a new policy in the year of Balas's death (A.D. 487), and
lent the pretender a force with which he was about to attack his uncle
when news reached him that attack was needless, since Balas was dead and
his own claim to the succession undisputed. Balas nominated no successor
upon his death-bed, thus giving in his last moments an additional proof
of that moderation and love of peace which had characterized his reign.
</p>
<p>
Coins, which possess several points of interest, are assigned to Balas
by the best authorities. They bear on the obverse the head of the king
with the usual mural crown surmounted by a crescent and inflated ball.
The beard is short and curled. The hair falls behind the head, also
in curls. The earring, wherewith the ear is ornamented, has a double
pendent. Flames issue from the left shoulder, an exceptional peculiarity
in the Sassanian series, but one which is found also among the
Indo-Scythian kings with whom Balas was so closely connected. The full
legend upon the coins appears to be <i>Hur Kadi Valdk-dshi,</i> "Volagases,
the Fire King." The reverse exhibits the usual fire-altar, but with
the king's head in the flames, and with the star and crescent on
either side, as introduced by Pe-rozes. It bears commonly the legend,
<i>ValaJcdshi</i>, with a mint-mark. The mints employed are those of Iran,
Kerman, Ispahan, Nisa, Ledan, Shiz, Zadracarta, and one or two others.

<p>
When Kobad fled to the Ephthalites on the failure of his attempt to
seize the crown, he was received, we are told, with open arms; but no
material aid was given to him for the space of three years. However, in
the fourth year of his exile, a change came over the Ephthalite policy,
and he returned to his capital at the head of an army, with which
Khush-newaz had furnished him. The change is reasonably connected with
the withholding of his tribute by Balas; and it is difficult to suppose
that Kobad, when he accepted Ephthalite aid, did not pledge himself to
resume the subordinate position which his uncle had been content to hold
for two years. It seems certain that he was accompanied to his capital
by an Ephthalite contingent, which he richly rewarded before dismissing
it. Owing his throne to the aid thus afforded him, he can scarcely have
refused to make the expected acknowledgment. Distinct evidence on the
point is wanting; but there can be little doubt that for some years
Kobad held the Persian throne on the condition of paying tribute to
Khush-newaz, and recognizing him as his lord paramount.
</p>
<p>
During the early portion of his first reign, which extended from A.D.
487 to 498, we are told that he entrusted the entire administration of
affairs to Suklira, or Sufrai, who had been the chief minister of his
uncle. Sufrai's son, Zer-Mihr, had faithfully adhered to him throughout
the whole period of his exile, and Kobad did not regard it as a crime
that the father had opposed his ambition, and thrown the weight of
his authority into the scale against him. He recognized fidelity as
a quality that deserved reward, and was sufficiently magnanimous to
forgive an opposition that had sprung from a virtuous motive, and,
moreover, had not succeeded. Sufrai accordingly governed Persia for some
years; the army obeyed him, and the civil administration was completely
in his hands. Under these circumstances it is not surprising that Kobad
after a while grew jealous of his subordinate, and was anxious to strip
him of the quasi-regal authority which he exercised and assert his own
right to direct affairs. But, alone, he felt unequal to such a task. He
therefore called in the assistance of an officer who bore the name of
Sapor, and had a command in the district of Rhages. Sapor undertook to
rid his sovereign of the incubus whereof he complained, and, with the
tacit sanction of the monarch, he contrived to fasten a quarrel on
Sufrai which he pushed to such an extremity that, at the end of it,
he dragged the minister from the royal apartment to a prison, had him
heavily ironed, and in a few days caused him to be put to death.
Sapor, upon this, took the place previously occupied by Sufrai; he
was recognized at once as Prime Minister, and Sipehbed, or
commander-in-chief of the troops. Kobad, content to have vindicated his
royal power by the removal of Sufrai, conceded to the second favorite
as much as he had allowed to the first, and once more suffered the
management of affairs to pass wholly into the hands of a subject.
</p>
<p>
The only war in which Persia seems to have been engaged during the first
reign of Kobad was one with the Khazars. This important people,
now heard of for the first time in Persian history, appears to have
occupied, in the reign of Kobad, the steppe country between the Wolga
and the Don, whence they made raids through the passes of the Caucasus
into the fertile provinces of Iberia, Albania, and Armenia. Whether
they were Turks, as is generally believed, or Circassians, as has been
ingeniously argued by a living writer, is doubtful; but we cannot be
mistaken in regarding them as at this time a race of fierce and terrible
barbarians, nomadic in their habits, ruthless in their wars, cruel and
uncivilized in their customs, a fearful curse to the regions which they
overrun and desolated. We shall meet with them again, more than once,
in the later history, and shall have to trace to their hostility some of
the worst disasters that befel the Persian arms. On this occasion it
is remarkable that they were repulsed with apparent ease. Kobad marched
against their Khan in person, at the head of a hundred thousand men,
defeated him in a battle, destroyed the greater portion of his army,
and returned to his capital with an enormous booty. To check their
incursions, he is said to have built on the Armenian frontier a town
called Amid, by which we are probably to understand, not the ancient
Amida (or Diarbekr), but a second city of the name, further to the
east and also further to the north, on the border line which separated
Armenia from Iberia.
</p>
<p>
The triumphant return of Kobad from his Khazar war might have seemed
likely to secure him a long and prosperous reign; but at the moment when
fortune appeared most to smile upon him, an insidious evil, which had
been gradually but secretly sapping the vitals of his empire, made
itself apparent, and, drawing the monarch within the sphere of its
influence, involved him speedily in difficulties which led to the loss
of his crown. Mazdak, a native of Persepolis, or, according to others,
of Nishapur, in Khorassan, and an Archimagus, or High Priest of the
Zoroastrian religion, announced himself, early in the reign of Kobad,
as a reformer of Zoroastrianism, and began to make proselytes to the new
doctrines which he declared himself commissioned to unfold. All men, he
said, were, by God's providence, born equal&mdash;none brought into the
world any property, or any natural right to possess more than another.
Property and marriage were mere human inventions, contrary to the will
of God, which required an equal division of the good things of this
world among all, and forbade the appropriation of particular women by
individual men. In communities based upon property and marriage, men
might lawfully vindicate their natural rights by taking their fair share
of the good things wrongfully appropriated by their fellows Adultery,
incest, theft, were not really crimes, but necessary steps towards
re-establishing the laws of nature in such societies. To these
communistic views, which seem to have been the original speculations
of his own mind, the Magian reformer added tenets borrowed from the
Brahmins or from some other Oriental ascetics, such as the sacredness
of animal life, the necessity of abstaining from animal food, other than
milk, cheese, or eggs, the propriety of simplicity in apparel, and the
need of abstemiousness and devotion. He thus presented the spectacle of
an enthusiast who preached a doctrine of laxity and self-indulgence,
not from any base or selfish motive, but simply from a conviction of its
truth. We learn without surprise that the doctrines of the new teacher
were embraced with ardor by large classes among the Persians, by the
young of all ranks, by the lovers of pleasure, by the great bulk of
the lower orders. But it naturally moves our wonder that among the
proselytes to the new religion was the king. Kobad, who had nothing to
gain from embracing a creed which levelled him with his subjects, and
was scarcely compatible with the continuance of monarchical rule, must
have been sincere in his profession; and we inquire with interest, what
were the circumstances which enabled Mazdak to attach to his cause so
important and so unlikely a convert.
</p>
<p>
The explanation wherewith we are furnished by our authorities is,
that Mazdak claimed to authenticate his mission by the possession and
exhibition of miraculous powers. In order to impose on the weak mind
of Kobad he arranged and carried into act an elaborate and clever
imposture. He excavated a cave below the fire-altar, on which he was in
the habit of offering, and contrived to pass a tube from the cavern to
the upper surface of the altar, where the sacred flame was maintained
perpetually. Having then placed a confederate in the cavern, he invited
the attendance of Kobad, and in his presence appeared to hold converse
with the fire itself, which the Persians viewed as the symbol and
embodiment of divinity. The king accepted the miracle as an absolute
proof of the divine authority of the new teacher, and became thenceforth
his zealous adherent and follower.
</p>
<p>
It may be readily imagined that the conversion of the monarch to such a
creed was, under a despotic government, the prelude to disorders, which
soon became intolerable. Not content with establishing community of
property and of women among themselves, the sectaries claimed the
right to plunder the rich at their pleasure, and to carry off for the
gratification of their own passions the inmates of the most illustrious
harems. In vain did the Mobeds declare that the new religion was false,
was monstrous, ought not to be tolerated for an hour. The followers of
Mazdak had the support of the monarch, and this protection secured them
complete impunity. Each day they grew bolder and more numerous. Persia
became too narrow a field for their ambition, and they insisted on
spreading their doctrines into the neighboring countries. We find traces
of the acceptance of their views in the distant West; and the historians
of Armenia relate that in that unhappy country they so pressed their
religion upon the people that an insurrection broke out, and Persia
was in danger of losing, by intolerance, one of her most valued
dependencies.
</p>
<p>
Vatian, the Mamigonian, who had been superseded in his office by a fresh
Marzpan, bent on forcing the Armenians to adopt the new creed, once more
put himself forward as his country's champion, took arms in defence
of the Christian faith, and endeavored to induce the Greek emperor,
Anastasius, to accept the sovereignty of Persarmenia, together with
the duty of protecting it against its late masters. Fear of the
consequences, if he provoked the hostility of Persia, caused Anastasius
to hesitate; and things might have gone hardly with the unfortunate
Armenians, had not affairs in Persia itself come about this time to a
crisis.
</p>
<p>
The Mobeds and the principal nobles had in vain protested against the
spread of the new religion and the patronage lent it by the Court.
At length appeal was made to the chief Mobed, and he was requested to
devise a remedy for the existing evils, which were generally felt to
have passed the limits of endurance. The chief Mobed decided that, under
the circumstances of the time, no remedy could be effectual but the
deposition of the head of the State, through whose culpable connivance
the disorders had attained their height. His decision was received with
general acquiescence. The Persian nobles agreed with absolute unanimity
to depose Kobad, and to place upon the throne another member of the
royal house. Their choice fell upon Zamasp, a brother of Kobad, who was
noted for his love of justice and for the mildness of his disposition.
The necessary arrangements having been made, they broke out into
universal insurrection, arrested Kobad, and committed him to safe
custody in the "Castle of Oblivion," proclaimed Zamasp, and crowned him
king with all the usual formalities. An attempt was then made to deal
the new religion a fatal blow by the seizure and execution of the
heresiarch, Mazdak. But here the counter-revolution failed. Mazdak was
seized indeed and imprisoned; but his followers rose at once, broke open
his prison doors, and set him at liberty. The government felt itself too
weak to insist on its intended policy of coercion. Mazdak was allowed
to live in retirement unmolested, and to increase the number of his
disciples.
</p>
<p>
The reign of Zamasp appears to have lasted from A.D. 498 to A.D. 501,
or between two and three years. He was urged by the army to put Kobad
to death, but hesitated to adopt so extreme a course, and preferred
retaining his rival as a prisoner. The "Castle of Oblivion" was regarded
as a place of safe custody; but the ex-king contrived in a short time to
put a cheat on his guards and effect his escape from confinement. Like
other claimants of the Persian throne, he at once took refuge with the
Ephthalites, and sought to persuade the Great Khan to embrace his cause
and place an army at his disposal. The Khan showed himself more than
ordinarily complaisant. He can scarcely have sympathized with the
religious leanings of his suppliant; but he remembered that he had
placed him upon the throne, and had found him a faithful feudatory and
a quiet neighbor. He therefore received him with every mark of honor,
betrothed him to one of his own daughters, and lent him an army of
30,000 men. With this force Kobad returned to Persia, and offered battle
to Zamasp. Zamasp declined the conflict. He had not succeeded in making
himself popular with his subjects, and knew that a large party desired
the return of his brother. It is probable that he did not greatly desire
a throne. At any rate, when his brother reached the neighborhood of the
capital, at the head of the 30,000 Ephthalites and of a strong body of
Persian adherents, Zamasp determined upon submission. He vacated the
throne in favor of Kobad, without risking the chance of a battle, and
descended voluntarily into a private station. Different stories are told
of his treatment by the restored monarch. According to Procopius, he
was blinded after a cruel method long established among the Persians;
but Mirkhond declares that he was pardoned, and even received from his
brother marked signs of affection and favor.
</p>
<p>
The coins of Zamasp have the usual inflated ball and mural crown, but
with a crescent in place of the front limb of the crown. The ends of the
diadem appear over the two shoulders. On either side of the head there
is a star, and over either shoulder a crescent. Outside the encircling
ring, or "pearl border," we see, almost for the first time, three stars
with crescents. The reverse bears the usual fire-altar, with a star and
crescent on either side of the flame. The legend is extremely brief,
being either <i>Zamasp</i> or <i>Bag Zamasp</i>, i.e. "Zamaspes," or "the divine
Zamaspes." <a href="#image-0003">[PLATE XXII., Fig. 1.]</a>

</p>
<p>
The second reign of Kobad covered a period of thirty years, extending
from A.D. 501 to A.D. 531. He was contemporary, during this space, with
the Roman emperors Anastasius, Justin, and Justinian, with Theodoric,
king of Italy, with Cassiodorus, Symmachus, Boethius, Procopius, and
Belisarius. The Oriental writers tell us but little of this portion of
his history. Their silence, however, is fortunately compensated by the
unusual copiousness of the Byzantines, who deliver, at considerable
length, the entire series of transactions in which Kobad was engaged
with the Constantinopolitan emperors, and furnish some interesting
notices of other matters which occupied him. Procopius especially, the
eminent rhetorician and secretary of Belisarius, who was born about the
time of Kobad's restoration to the Persian thrones and became secretary
to the great general four years before Kobad's death, is ample in his
details of the chief occurrences, and deserves a confidence which the
Byzantines can rarely claim, from being at once a contemporary and a man
of remarkable intelligence. "His facts," as Gibbon well observes, "are
collected from the personal experience and free conversation of a
soldier, a statesman, and a traveller; his style continually aspires,
and often attains, to the merit of strength and elegance; his,
reflections, more especially in the speeches, which he too frequently
inserts, contain a rich fund of political knowledge; and the historian,
excited by the generous ambition of pleasing and instructing posterity,
appears to disdain the prejudices of the people and the flattery of
courts."
</p>
<p>
The first question which Kobad had to decide, when, by the voluntary
cession of his brother, Zamasp, he remounted his throne, was the
attitude which he should assume towards Mazdak and his followers. By
openly favoring the new religion and encouraging the disorders of its
votaries, he had so disgusted the more powerful classes of his subjects
that he had lost his crown and been forced to become a fugitive in a
foreign country. He was not prepared to affront this danger a second
time. Still, his attachment to the new doctrine was not shaken; he held
the views propounded to be true, and was not ashamed to confess himself
an unwavering adherent of the communistic prophet. He contrived,
however, to reconcile his belief with his interests by separating the
individual from the king. As a man, he held the views of Mazdak; but, as
a king, he let it be known that he did not intend to maintain or support
the sectaries in any extreme or violent measures. The result was that
the new doctrine languished; Mazdak escaped persecution and continued to
propagate his views; but, practically, the progress of the new opinions
was checked; they had ceased to command royal advocacy, and had
consequently ceased to endanger the State; they still fermented among
the masses, and might cause trouble in the future; but for the present
they were the harmless speculations of a certain number of enthusiasts
who did not venture any more to carry their theories into practice.
</p>
<p>
Kobad had not enjoyed the throne for more than a year before his
relations with the great empire on his western frontier became troubled,
and, after some futile negotiations, hostilities once more broke out. It
appears that among the terms of the peace concluded in A.D. 442 between
Isdigerd II. and the younger Theodosius, the Romans had undertaken
to pay annually a certain sum of money as a contribution towards the
expenses of a fortified post which the two powers undertook to maintain
in the pass of Derbend, between the last spurs of the Caucasus and the
Caspian. This fortress, known as Juroi-pach or Biraparach, commanded the
usual passage by which the hordes of the north were accustomed to issue
from their vast arid steppes upon the rich and populous regions of the
south for the purpose of plundering raids, if not of actual conquests.
Their incursions threatened almost equally Roman and Persian territory,
and it was felt that the two nations were alike interested in preventing
them. The original agreement was that both parties should contribute
equally, alike to the building and to the maintaining of the fortress;
but the Romans were so occupied in other wars that the entire burden
actually fell upon the Persians. These latter, as was natural, made from
time to time demands upon the Romans for the payment of their share of
the expenses; but it seems that these efforts were ineffectual, and the
debt accumulated. It was under these circumstances that Kobad. finding
himself in want of money to reward adequately his Ephthalite allies,
sent an embassy to Anastasius, the Roman emperor, with a peremptory
demand for a remittance. The reply of Anastasius was a refusal.
According to one authority he declined absolutely to make any payment;
according to another, he expressed his willingness to lend his Persian
brother a sum of money on receiving the customary acknowledgment, but
refused an advance on any other terms. Such a response was a simple
repudiation of obligations voluntarily contracted, and could scarcely
fail to rouse the indignation of the Persian monarch. If he learned
further that the real cause of the refusal was a desire to embroil
Persia with the Ephthalites, and to advance the interests of Rome by
leading her enemies to waste each other's strength in an internecine
conflict, he may have admired the cunning of his rival, but can scarcely
have felt the more amicably disposed towards him.
</p>
<p>
The natural result followed. Kobad at once declared war. The two empires
had now been uninterruptedly at peace for sixty, and, with the exception
of a single campaign (that of A.D. 441), for eighty years. They had
ceased to feel that respect for each other's arms and valor which
experience gives, and which is the best preservative against wanton
hostilities. Kobad was confident in his strength, since he was able
to bring into the field, besides the entire force of Persia, a largo
Ephthalite contingent, and also a number of Arabs. Anastasius, perhaps,
scarcely thought that Persia would go to war on account of a pecuniary
claim which she had allowed to be disregarded for above half a century.
The resolve of Kobad evidently took him by surprise; but he had gone too
far to recede. The Roman pride would not allow him to yield to a display
of force what he had refused when demanded peacefully; and he was thus
compelled to maintain by arms the position which he had assumed without
anticipating its consequences.
</p>
<p>
The war began by a sudden inroad of the host of Persia into Roman
Armenia, where Theodosiopolis was still the chief stronghold and the
main support of the Roman power. Unprepared for resistance, this city
was surrendered after a short siege by its commandant, Constantine,
after which the greater part of Armenia was overrun and ravaged. From
Armenia Kobad conducted his army into Northern Mesopotamia, and formed
the siege of Amida about the commencement of the winter. The great
strength of Amida has been already noticed in this volume. Kobad found
it ungarrisoned, and only protected by a small force, cantoned in its
neighborhood, under the philosopher, Alypius. But the resolution of the
townsmen, and particularly of the monks, was great; and a most strenuous
resistance met all his efforts to take the place. At first his hope was
to effect a breach in the defences by means of the ram; but the besieged
employed the customary means of destroying his engines, and, where these
failed, the strength and thickness of the walls was found to be
such that no serious impression could be made on them by the Persian
battering train. It was necessary to have recourse to some other device;
and Kobad proceeded to erect a mound in the immediate neighborhood of
the wall, with a view of dominating the town, driving the defenders from
the battlements, and then taking the place by escalade. He raised an
immense work; but it was undermined by the enemy, and at last fell in
with a terrible crash, involving hundreds in its ruin. It is said that
after this failure Kobad despaired of success, and determined to draw
off his army; but the taunts and insults of the besieged, or confidence
in the prophecies of the Magi, who saw an omen of victory in the
grossest of all the insults, caused him to change his intention and
still continue the siege. His perseverance was soon afterwards rewarded.
A soldier discovered in the wall the outlet of a drain or sewer
imperfectly blocked up with rubble, and, removing this during the
night, found himself able to pass through the wall into the town. He
communicated his discovery to Kobad, who took his measures accordingly.
Sending, the next night, a few picked men through the drain, to seize
the nearest tower, which happened to be slackly guarded by some sleepy
monks, who the day before had been keeping festival, he brought the bulk
of his troops with scaling ladders to the adjoining portion of the wall,
and by his presence, exhortations, and threats, compelled them to force
their way into the place. The inhabitants resisted strenuously, but were
overpowered by numbers, and the carnage in the streets was great. At
last an aged priest, shocked at the indiscriminate massacre, made bold
to address the monarch himself and tell him that it was no kingly act to
slaughter captives. "Why, then, did you elect to fight?" said the angry
prince. "It was God's doing," replied the priest, astutely; "He willed
that thou shouldest owe thy conquest of Amida, not to our weakness, but
to thy own valor." The flattery pleased Kobad, and induced him to stop
the effusion of blood; but the sack was allowed to continue; the whole
town was pillaged; and the bulk of the inhabitants were carried off as
slaves.
</p>
<p>
The siege of Amida lasted eighty days, and the year A.D. 503 had
commenced before it was over. Anastasius, on learning the danger of his
frontier town, immediately despatched to its aid a considerable force,
which he placed under four commanders&mdash;Areobindus, the grandson of the
Gothic officer of the same name who distinguished himself in the Persian
war of Theodosius; Celer, captain of the imperial guard; Patricius, the
Phrygian; and Hypatius, one of his own nephews. The army, collectively,
is said to have been more numerous than any that Rome had ever brought
into the field against the Persians but it was weakened by the divided
command, and it was moreover broken up into detachments which acted
independently of each other. Its advent also was tardy. Not only did
it arrive too late to save Amida, but it in no way interfered with the
after-movements of Kobad, who, leaving a small garrison to maintain his
new conquest, carried off the whole of his rich booty to his city of
Nisibis, and placed the bulk of his troops in a good position upon
his own frontier. When Areobindus, at the head of the first division,
reached Amida and heard that the Persians had fallen back, he declined
the comparatively inglorious work of a siege, and pressed forward,
anxious to carry the war into Persian territory. He seems actually to
have crossed the border and invaded the district of Arzanene, when
news reached him that Kobad was marching upon him with all his troops,
whereupon he instantly fled, and threw himself into Constantia, leaving
his camp and stores to be taken by the enemy. Meanwhile another division
of the Roman army, under Patrilcius and Hypatius, had followed in the
steps of Areobindus, and meeting with the advance-guard of Kobad, which
consisted of eight hundred Ephthalites, had destroyed it almost to a
man.
</p>
<p>
Ignorant, however, of the near presence of the main Persian army, this
body of troops allowed itself soon afterwards to be surprised on the
banks of a stream, while some of the men were bathing and others were
taking their breakfast, and was completely cut to pieces by Kobad,
scarcely any but the generals escaping.
</p>
<p>
Thus far success had been wholly on the side of the Persians; and if
circumstances had permitted Kobad to remain at the seat of war and
continue to direct the operations of his troops in person, there is
every to reason to believe that he would have gained still greater
advantages. The Roman generals were incompetent; they were at variance
among themselves; and they were unable to control the troops under their
command. The soldiers were insubordinate, without confidence in their
officers, and inclined to grumble at such an unwonted hardship as a
campaign prolonged into the winter. Thus all the conditions of the war
were in favor of Persia. But unfortunately for Kobad, it happened that,
at the moment when his prospects were the fairest, a danger in another
quarter demanded his presence, and required him to leave the conduct
of the Roman war to others. An Ephthalite invasion called him to the
defence of his north-eastern frontier before the year A.D. 503 was over,
and from this time the operations in Mesopotamia were directed, not by
the king in person, but by his generals. A change is at once apparent.
In A.D. 504 Celer invaded Arzanene, destroyed a number of forts,
and ravaged the whole province with fire and sword. Thence marching
southward, he threated Nisibis, which is said, to have been within a
little of yielding itself. Towards winter Patricius and Hypatius took
heart, and, collecting an army, commenced the siege of Amida, which they
attempted to storm on several occasions, but without success. After a
while they turned the siege into a blockade, entrapped the commander of
the, Persian garrison, Glones, by a stratagem, and reduced the defenders
of the place to such distress that it would have been impossible to hold
put much longer. It seems to have been when matters were at this
point that an ambassador of high rank arrived from Kobad, empowered to
conclude a peace, and instructed to declare his master's willingness
to surrender all his conquests, including Amida, on the payment of
a considerable sum of money. The Roman generals, regarding Amida as
impregnable, and not aware of the exhaustion of its stores, gladly
consented. They handed over to the Persians a thousand pounds' weight of
gold, and received in exchange the captured city and territory. A treaty
was signed by which the contracting powers undertook to remain at peace
and respect each other's dominions for the space of seven years. No
definite arrangement seems to have been made with respect to the yearly
payment on account of the fortress, Birapa-rach, the demand for which
had occasioned the war. This claim remained in abeyance, to be pressed
or neglected, as Persia might consider her interests to require.
</p>
<p>
The Ephthalite war, which compelled Kobad to make peace with Anastasius,
appears to have occupied him uninterruptedly for ten years. During its
continuance Rome took advantage of her rival's difficulties to continue
the system (introduced under the younger Theodosius) of augmenting
her own power, and crippling that of Persia, by establishing strongly
fortified posts upon her border in the immediate vicinity of Persian
territory. Not content with restoring Theodosiopolis and greatly
strengthening it defences, Anastasius erected an entirely new fortress
at Daras, on the southern skirts of the Mons Masius, within twelve miles
of Nisibis, at the edge of the great Mesopotamian plain. This place was
not a mere fort, but a city; it contained churches, baths, porticoes,
large granaries, and extensive cisterns. It constituted a standing
menace to Persia; and its erection was in direct violation of the treaty
made by Theodosius with Isdigerd II., which was regarded as still in
force by both nations.
</p>
<p>
We cannot be surprised that Kobad, when his Ephthalite war was over,
made formal complaint at Constantinople (ab. A.D. 517); of the infraction
of the treaty. Anastasius was unable to deny the charge. He endeavored
at first to meet it by a mixture of bluster with professions of
friendship; but when this method did not appear effectual he had
recourse to an argument whereof the Persians on most occasions
acknowledged the force. By the expenditure of a large sum of money he
either corrupted the ambassadors of Kobad, or made them honestly doubt
whether the sum paid would not satisfy their master.
</p>
<p>
In A.D. 518 Anastasius died, and the imperial authority was assumed by
the Captain of the Guard, the "Dacian peasant," Justin. With him Kobad
very shortly entered jinto negotiations. He had not, it is clear,
accepted the pecuniary sacrifice of Anastasius as a complete
satisfaction. He felt that he had many grounds of quarrel with the
Romans, There was the old matter of the annual payment due on account
of the fortress of Biraparach; there was the recent strengthening
of Theodosiopolis, and building of Daras; there was moreover an
interference of Rome at this time in the region about the Caucasus which
was very galling to Persia and was naturally resented by her monarch.
One of the first proceedings of Justin after he ascended the throne
was to send an embassy with rich gifts to the court of a certain Hunnic
chief of these parts, called Ziligdes or Zilgibis, and to conclude a
treaty with him by which the Hun bound himself to assist the Romans
against the Persians. Soon afterwards a Lazic prince, named Tzath, whose
country was a Persian dependency, instead of seeking inauguration
from Kobad, proceeded on the death of his father to the court of
Constantinople, and expressed his wish to become a Christian, and to
hold his crown as one of Rome's vassal monarchs. Justin gave this person
a warm welcome, had him baptized, married him to a Roman lady of
rank, and sent him back to Lazica adorned with a diadem and robes that
sufficiently indicated his dependent position. The friendly relations
established between Rome and Persia by the treaty of A.D. 505 were,
under these circumstances, greatly disturbed, and on both sides it would
seem that war was expected to break out. But neither Justin nor Kobad
was desirous of a rupture. Both were advanced in years, and both had
domestic troubles to occupy them. Kobad was at this time especially
anxious about the succession. He had four sons, Kaoses, Zames,
Phthasuarsas, and Chosroes, of whom Kaoses was the eldest. This prince,
however, did not please him. His affections were fixed on his fourth
son, Chosroes, and he had no object more at heart than to secure the
crown for this favorite child. The Roman writers tell us that instead
of resenting the proceedings of Justin in the years A.D. 520-522, Kobad
made the strange proposal to him about this time that he should adopt
Chosroes, in order that that prince might have the aid of the Romans
against his countrymen, if his right of succession should be disputed.
It is, no doubt, difficult to believe that such a proposition should
have been made; but the circumstantial manner in which Procopius,
writing not forty years after, relates the matter, renders it almost
impossible for us to reject the story as a pure fabrication. There must
have been some foundation for it. In the negotiations between Justin and
Kobad during the early years of the former, the idea of Rome pledging
herself to acknowledge Chosroes as his father's successor must have been
brought forward. The proposal, whatever its exact terms, led however to
no result. Rome declined to do as Kobad desired; and thus another ground
of estrangement was added to those which had previously made the renewal
of the Roman war a mere question of time.
</p>
<p>
It is probable that the rupture would have occurred earlier than it did
had not Persia about the year A.D. 523 become once more the scene of
religious discord and conspiracy. The followers of Mazdak had been
hitherto protected by Kobad, and had lived in peace and multiplied
throughout all the provinces of the empire. Content with the toleration
which they enjoyed, they had for above twenty years created no
disturbance, and their name had almost disappeared from the records of
history. But as time went on they began to feel that their position was
insecure. Their happiness, their very safety, depended upon a single
life; and as Kobad advanced in years they grew to dread more and more
the prospect which his death would open. Among his sons there was but
one who had embraced their doctrine; and this prince, Phthasuarsas, had
but little chance of being chosen to be his father's successor. Kaoses
enjoyed the claim of natural right; Chosroes was his father's favorite;
Zames had the respect and good wishes of the great mass of the people;
Phthasuarsas was disliked by the Magi, and, if the choice lay with them,
was certain to be passed over. The sectaries therefore determined not
to wait the natural course of events, but to shape them to their own
purposes. They promised Phthasuarsas to obtain by their prayers his
father's abdication and his own appointment to succeed him, and asked
him to pledge himself to establish their religion as that of the State
when he became king. The prince consented; and the Mazdakites proceeded
to arrange their plans, when, unfortunately for them, Kobad discovered,
or suspected, that a scheme was on foot to deprive him of his crown.
Whether the designs of the sectaries were really treasonable or not is
uncertain; but whatever they were, an Oriental monarch was not likely to
view them with favor. In the East it is an offence even to speculate on
the death of the king; and Kobad saw in the intrigue which had been set
on foot a criminal and dangerous conspiracy. He determined at once to
crush the movement. Inviting the Mazdakites to a solemn assembly, at
which he was to confer the royal dignity on Phthasuarsas, he caused his
army to surround the unarmed multitude and massacre the entire number.
</p>
<p>
Relieved from this peril, Kobad would at once have declared war against
Justin, and have marched an army into Roman territory, had not troubles
broken out in Iberia, which made it necessary for him to stand on the
defensive. Adopting the intolerant policy so frequently pursued,
and generally with such ill results, by the Persian kings, Kobad had
commanded Gurgenes, the Iberian monarch, to renounce Christianity and
profess the Zoroastrian religion. Especially he had required that the
Iberian custom of burying the dead should be relinquished, and that the
Persian practice of exposing corpses to be devoured by dogs and birds of
prey should supersede the Christian rite of sepulture. Gurgenes was
too deeply attached to his faith to entertain these propositions for a
moment. He at once shook off the Persian yoke, and, declaring himself
a vassal of Rome, obtained a promise from Justin that he would never
desert the Iberian cause. Rome, however, was not prepared to send her
own armies into this distant and inhospitable region; her hope was
to obtain aid from the Tatars of the Crimea, and to play off these
barbarians against the forces wherewith Kobad might be expected shortly
to vindicate his authority. An attempt to engage the Crimeans generally
in this service was made, but it was not successful. A small force was
enrolled and sent to the assistance of Gurgenes. But now the Persians
took the field in strength. A large army was sent into Iberia by Kobad,
under a general named Boes. Gurgenes saw resistance to be impossible.
He therefore fled the country, and threw himself into Lazica, where
the difficult nature of the ground, the favor of the natives, and
the assistance of the Romans enabled him to maintain himself. Iberia,
however, was lost, and passed once more under the Persians, who even
penetrated into Lazic territory and occupied some forts which commanded
the passes between Lazica and Iberia.
</p>
<p>
Rome, on her part, endeavored to retaliate (A.D. 526) by invading
Persarmenia and Mesopotamia. The campaign is remarkable as that in
which the greatest general of the age, the renowned and unfortunate
Belisarius, first held a command and thus commenced the work of
learning by experience the duties of a military leader. Hitherto a mere
guardsman, and still quite a youth, trammelled moreover by association
with a colleague, he did not on this occasion reap any laurels.
A Persian force under two generals, Narses and Aratius, defended
Persarmenia, and, engaging the Romans under Sittas and Belisarius,
succeeded in defeating them. At the same time, Licelarius, a Thracian in
the Roman service, made an incursion into the tract about Nisibis,
grew alarmed without cause and beat a speedy retreat. Hereupon Justin
recalled him as incompetent, and the further conduct of the war in
Mesopotamia was entrusted to Belisarius, who took up his headquarters at
Daras.
</p>
<p>
The year A.D. 527 seems to have been one in which nothing of importance
was attempted on either side. At Constantinople the Emperor Justin had
fallen into ill health, and, after associating his nephew Justinian on
the 1st of April, had departed this life on the 1st of August. About the
same time Kobad found his strength insufficient for active warfare, and
put the command of his armies into the hands of his sons. The struggle
continued in Lazica, but with no decisive result. At Daras, Belisarius,
apparently, stood on the defensive. It was not till A.D. 528 had set in
that he resumed operations in the open field, and prepared once more to
measure his strength against that of Persia.
</p>
<p>
Belisarius was stirred from his repose by an order from court. Desirous
of carrying further the policy of gaining ground by means of fortified
posts, Justinian, who had recently restored and strengthened the
frontier city of Martyropolis, on the Nymphius, sent instructions to
Belisarius, early in A.D. 528, to the effect that he was to build a new
fort at a place called Mindon, on the Persian border a little to the
left of Nisibis. The work was commenced, but the Persians would not
allow it to proceed. An army which numbered 30,000 men, commanded
by Xerxes, son of Kobad, and Perozes, the Mihran, attacked the Roman
workmen; and when Belisarius, reinforced by fresh troops from Syria and
Phoenicia, ventured an engagement, he was completely defeated and forced
to seek safety in flight. The attempted fortification was, upon this,
razed to the ground; and the Mihran returned, with numerous prisoners of
importance, into Persia.
</p>
<p>
It is creditable to Justinian that he did not allow the ill-success of
his lieutenant to lead to his recall or disgrace. On the contrary, he
chose exactly the time of his greatest depression to give him the title
of "General of the East." Belisarius upon this assembled at Daras an
imposing force, composed of Romans and allies, the latter being chiefly
Massagetse. The entire number amounted to 25,000 men; and with this
army he would probably have assumed the offensive, had not the Persian
general of the last campaign, Perozes the Mihran, again appeared in
the field, at the head of 40,000 Persians and declared his intention of
besieging and taking Daras. With the insolence of an Oriental he sent a
message to Belisarius, requiring him to have his bath prepared for the
morrow, as after taking the town he would need that kind of refreshment.
Belisarius contented himself, in reply, with drawing out his troops in
front of Daras in a position carefully prepared beforehand, where both
his centre and his flanks would be protected by a deep ditch, outside
of which there would be room to act for his cavalry. Perozes, having
reconnoitred the position, hesitated to attack it without a greater
advantage of numbers, and sent hastily to Nisibis for 10,000 more
soldiers, while he allowed the day to pass without anything more serious
than a demonstration of his calvary against the Roman left, and some
insignificant single combats.
</p>
<p>
The next morning his reinforcement arrived; and after some exchange of
messages with Belisarius, which led to no result, he commenced active
operations. Placing his infantry in the centre, and his horse upon
either wing, as the Romans had likewise done, and arranging his
infantry so that one half should from time to time relieve the other,
he assaulted the Roman line with a storm of darts and arrows. The Romans
replied with their missile weapons; but the Persians had the advantage
of numbers; they were protected by huge wattled shields; and they were
more accustomed to this style of warfare than their adversaries. Still
the Romans held out; but it was a relief to them when the missile
weapons were exhausted on both sides, and a closer fight began along the
whole line with swords and spears. After a while the Roman left was in
difficulties. Here the Cadiseni (Cadusians?) under Pituazes routed their
opponents, and were pursuing them hastily when the Massagetic horse,
commanded by Sunicas and Aigan, and three hundred Heruli under a chief
called Pharas, charged them on their right flank, and at once threw them
into disorder. Three thousand fell, and the rest were driven back upon
their main body, which, still continued to fight bravely. The Romans did
not push their advantage, but were satisfied to reoccupy the ground from
which they had been driven.
</p>
<p>
Scarcely was the battle re-established in this quarter when the Romans
found themselves in still greater difficulties upon their right.
Here Perozes had determined to deliver his main attack. The corps of
Immortals, which he had kept in reserve, and such troops as he could
spare from his centre, were secretly massed upon his own left, and
charged the Roman right with such fury that it was broken and began a
hasty retreat. The Persians pursued in a long column, and were carrying
all before them, when once more an impetuous flank charge of the
barbarian cavalry, which now formed an important element in the Roman
armies, changed the face of affairs, and indeed decided the fortune of
the day. The Persian column was actually cut in two by the Massagetic
horse; those who had advanced the furthest were completely separated
from their friends, and were at once surrounded and slain. Among them
was the standard-bearer of Baresmanes, who commanded the Persian left.
The fall of this man increased the general confusion. In vain did the
Persian column, checked in its advance, attempt an orderly retreat. The
Romans assaulted it in front and on both flanks, and a terrible carnage
ensued. The crowning disaster was the death of Baresmanes, who was slain
by Sunicas, the Massa-Goth; whereupon the whole Persian army broke and
fled without offering any further resistance. Here fell 5000, including
numbers of the "Immortals." The slaughter would have been still greater,
had not Belisarius and his lieutenant, Termogenes, with wise caution
restrained the Roman troops and recalled them quickly from the pursuit
of the enemy, content with the success which they had achieved. It was
so long since a Roman army had defeated a Persian one in the open field
that the victory had an extraordinary value, and it would have
been foolish to risk a reverse in the attempt to give it greater
completeness.
</p>
<p>
While these events took place in Mesopotamia, the Persian arms were also
unsuccessful in the Armenian highlands, whither Kobad had sent a second
army to act offensively against Rome, under the conduct of a certain
Mermeroes. The Roman commanders in this region were Sittas, the former
colleague of Belisarius, and Dorotheas, a general of experience. Their
troops did not amount to more than half the number of the enemy, yet
they contrived to inflict on the Persians two defeats, one in their own
territory, the other in Roman Armenia. The superiority thus exhibited
by the Romans encouraged desertions to their side; and in some instances
the deserters were able to carry over with them to their new friends
small portions of Persian territory.
</p>
<p>
In the year A.D. 531, after a vain attempt at negotiating terms of
peace with Rome, the Persians made an effort to recover their laurels
by carrying the war into a new quarter and effecting a new combination.
Alamandarus, sheikh of the Saracenic Arabs, had long been a bitter
enemy of the Romans, and from his safe retreat in the desert had been
accustomed for fifty years to ravage, almost at his will, the eastern
provinces of the empire. Two years previously he had carried fire and
sword through the regions of upper Syria, had burned the suburbs of
Chalcis, and threatened the Roman capital of the East, the rich and
luxurious Antioch. He owed, it would seem, some sort of allegiance
to Persia, although practically he was independent, and made his
expeditions when and where he pleased. However, in A.D. 531, he put
himself at the disposal of Persia, proposed a joint expedition, and
suggested a new plan of campaign. "Mesopotamia and Osrhoene," he said,
"on which the Persians were accustomed to make their attacks, could
better resist them than almost any other part of the Roman territory,
In these provinces were the strongest of the Roman cities, fortified
according to the latest rules of art, and plentifully supplied with
every appliance of defensive warfare. There, too, were the best and
bravest of the Roman troops, and an army more numerous than Rome had
ever employed against Persia before. It would be most perilous to risk
an encounter on this ground. Let Persia, however, invade the country
beyond the Euphrates, and she would find but few obstacles. In that
region there were no strong fortresses, nor was there any army worth
mention. Antioch itself, the richest and most populous city of the Roman
East, was without a garrison, and, if it were suddenly assaulted, could
probably be taken. The incursion might be made, Antioch sacked, and
the booty carried off into Persian territory before the Romans in
Mesopotamia received intelligence of what was happening." Kobad listened
with approval, and determined to adopt the bold course suggested to him.
He levied a force of 15,000 cavalry, and, placing it under the command
of a general named Azarethes, desired him to take Alamandarus for his
guide and make a joint expedition with him across the Euphrates. It was
understood that the great object of the expedition was the capture of
Antioch.
</p>
<p>
The allied army crossed the Euphrates below Circesium, and ascended the
right bank of the river till they neared the latitude of Antioch, when
they struck westward and reached Gabbula (the modern Jabul), on the
north shore of the salt lake now known as the Sabakhah. Here they
learned to their surprise that the movement, which they had intended to
be wholly unknown to the Romans, had come to the ears of Belisarius,
who had at once quitted Daras, and proceeded by forced marches to the
defence of Syria, into which he had thrown himself with an army of
20,000 men, Romans, Isaurians, Lycaonians, and Arabs. His troops were
already interposed between the Persians and their longed-for prey,
Belisarius having fixed his headquarters at Chalcis, half a degree
to the west of Gabbula, and twenty-five miles nearer to Antioch. Thus
balked of their purpose, and despairing of any greater success than they
had already achieved, the allies became anxious to return to Persia with
the plunder of the Syrian towns and villages which they had sacked on
their advance. Belisarius was quite content that they should carry off
their spoil, and would have considered it a sufficient victory to have
frustrated the expedition without striking a blow. But his army was
otherwise minded; they were eager for battle, and hoped doubtless to
strip the flying foe of his rich booty. Belisarius was at last forced,
against his better judgment, to indulge their desires and allow an
engagement, which was fought on the banks of the Euphrates, nearly
opposite Callinicus. Here the conduct of the Roman troops in action
corresponded but ill to the anxiety for a conflict. The infantry indeed
stood firm, notwithstanding that they fought fasting; but the Saracenic
Arabs, of whom a portion were on the Roman side, and the Isaurian and
Lycaonian horse, who had been among the most eager for the fray, offered
scarcely any resistance; and, the right wing of the Romans being left
exposed by their flight, Belisarius was compelled to make his troops
turn their faces to the enemy and their backs to the Euphrates, and in
this position, where defeat would have been ruin, to meet and resist
all the assaults of the foe until the shades of evening fell, and he was
able to transport his troops in boats across the river. The honors of
victory rested with the Persians, but they had gained no substantial
advantage; and when Azarethes returned to his master he was not unjustly
reproached with having sacrificed many lives for no appreciable result.
The raid into Syria had failed of its chief object; and Belisarius,
though defeated, had returned, with the main strength of his army
intact, into Mesopotamia. The battle of Callinicus was fought on Easter
Eve, April 19.
</p>
<p>
Azarethes probably reached Ctesiphon and made his report to Kobad
towards the end of the month. Dissatisfied with what Azarethes had
achieved, and feeling that the season was not too far advanced for
a second campaign, Kobad despatched an army under three chiefs, into
Mesopotamia, where Sittas was now the principal commander on the Roman
side, as Belisarius had been hastily summoned to Byzantium in order to
be employed against the "Vandals" in Africa. This force found no one to
resist in the open field, and was therefore able to invade Sophene and
lay siege to the Roman fortress of Martyropolis. Martyropolis was ill
provisioned, and its walls were out of repair. The Persians must soon
have taken it, had not Sittas contrived to spread reports of a diversion
which the Huns were about to make as Roman allies. Fear of being caught
between two fires paralyzed the Persian commanders; and before events
undeceived them, news arrived in the camp that Kobad was dead, and
that a new prince sat upon the throne. Under these circumstances,
Chanaranges, the chief of the Persian commanders, yielded to
representations made by Sittas, that peace would now probably be made
between the contending powers, and withdrew his army into Persian
territory.
</p>
<p>
Kobad had, in fact, been seized with paralysis on the 8th of September,
and after an illness which lasted only five days, had expired. Before
dying, he had communicated to his chief minister, Mebodes, his earnest
desire that Chosroes should succeed him upon the throne, and, acting
under the advice of Mebodes, had formally left the crown to him by a
will duly executed. He is said by a contemporary to have been eighty-two
years old at his death, an age very seldom attained by an Oriental
monarch. His long life was more than usually eventful, and he cannot be
denied the praise of activity, perseverance, fertility of resource, and
general military capacity. But he was cruel and fickle; he disgraced his
ministers and his generals on insufficient grounds; he allowed himself,
from considerations of policy, to smother his religious convictions; and
he risked subjecting Persia to the horrors of a civil war, in order to
gratify a favoritism which, however justified by the event, seems to
have rested on no worthy motive. Chosroes was preferred on account
of his beauty, and because he was the son of Kobad's best-loved wife,
rather than for any good qualities; and inherited the kingdom, not so
much because he had shown any capacity to govern as because he was his
father's darling.
</p>
<p>
The coins of Kobad are, as might be expected from the length of his
reign, very numerous. In their general appearance they resemble those of
Zamasp, but do not exhibit quite so many stars and crescents. The legend
on the obverse is either "Kavdt" or "Kavdt" afzui, i.e. "Kobad," or
"May Kobad be increased." The reverse shows the regnal year, which
ranges from eleven to forty-three, together with a mint-mark. The
mint-marks, which are nearly forty in number, comprise almost all those
of Perozes, together with about thirteen others. <a href="#image-0003">[PLATE XXII. Fig. 2.]</a>

</p>
<p>
The accession of Chosroes was not altogether undisputed, Kaoses, the
eldest of the sons of Kobad, regarding himself as entitled to the crown
by right of birth, assumed the insignia of royalty on the death of his
father, and claimed to be acknowledged as monarch. But Mebodes, the
Grand Vizier, interposed with the assertion of a constitutional axiom,
that no one had the right of taking the Persian crown until it was
assigned to him by the assembly of the nobles. Kaoses, who thought he
might count on the goodwill of the nobles, acquiesced; and the assembly
being convened, his claims were submitted to it. Hereupon Mebodes
brought forward the formal testament of Kobad, which he had hitherto
concealed, and, submitting it to the nobles, exhorted them to accept as
king the brave prince designated by a brave and successful father. His
eloquence and authority prevailed; the claims of Kaoses and of at least
one other son of Kobad were set aside; and, in accordance with his
father's will, Chosroes was proclaimed lawful monarch of Persia.
</p>
<p>
But a party among the nobles were dissatisfied with the decision to
which the majority had come. They dreaded the restlessness, and probably
feared the cruelty, of Chosroes. It might have been expected that they
would have espoused the cause of the disappointed Kaoses, which had
a solid basis of legality to rest upon; but, apparently, the personal
character of Kaoses was unsatisfactory, or at any rate, there was
another prince whose qualities conciliated more regard and aroused more
enthusiasm. Zanies, the second son of Kobad, had distinguished himself
repeatedly in the field, and was the idol of a considerable section
of the nation, who had long desired that he should govern them.
Unfortunately, however, he possessed a disqualification fatal in the
eyes of Orientals; he had, by disease or mischance, lost one of his
eyes, and this physical blemish made it impossible that he should occupy
the Persian throne. Under these circumstances an ingenious plan was hit
upon. In order to combine respect for law and usage with the practical
advantage of being governed by the man of their choice, the discontented
nobles conceived the idea of conferring the crown on a son of Zames,
a boy named after his grandfather Kobad, on whose behalf Zames would
naturally be regent. Zames readily came into the plot; several of his
brothers, and, what is most strange, Chosroes' maternal uncle, the
Aspebed, supported him; the conspiracy seemed nearly sure of success,
when by some accident it was discovered, and the occupant of the throne
took prompt and effectual measures to crush it. Zames, Kaoses, and all
the other sons of Kobad were seized by order of Chosroes, and, together
with their entire male offspring, were condemned to death. The Aspebed,
and the other nobles found to have been accessory to the conspiracy,
were, at the same time, executed. One prince alone, the intended
puppet-king, Kobad, escaped, through the compassion of the Persian who
had charge of him, and, after passing many years in concealment, became
a refugee at the Court of Constantinople, where he was kindly treated by
Justinian.
</p>
<p>
When Chosroes had by these means secured himself against the claims
of pretenders, he proceeded to employ equal severity in repressing the
disorders, punishing the crimes, and compelling the abject submission
of his subjects. The heresiarch Mazdak, who had escaped the persecution
instituted in his later years by Kobad, and the sect of the Mazdakites,
which, despite that persecution, was still strong and vigorous, were
the first to experience the oppressive weight of his resentment; and the
corpses of a hundred thousand martyrs blackening upon gibbets proved
the determination of the new monarch to make his will law, whatever
the consequences. In a similar spirit the hesitation of Mebodes to obey
instantaneously an order sent him by the king was punished capitally,
and with circumstances of peculiar harshness, by the stern prince, who
did not allow gratitude for old benefits to affect the judgments which
he passed on recent offences. Nor did signal services in the field avail
to save Chanaranges, the nobleman who preserved the young Kobad, from
his master's vengeance. The conqueror of twelve nations, betrayed by an
unworthy son, was treacherously entrapped and put to death on account of
a single humane act which had in no way harmed or endangered the jealous
monarch.
</p>
<p>
The fame of Chosroes rests especially on his military exploits and
successes. On first ascending the throne he seems, however, to have
distrusted his capacity for war; and it was with much readiness that he
accepted the overtures for peace made by Justinian, who was anxious
to bring the Eastern war to a close, in order that he might employ the
talents of Belisarius in the reduction of Africa and Italy. A truce
was made between Persia and Rome early in A.D. 532; and the truce was
followed after a short interval by a treaty&mdash;known as "the endless
peace"&mdash;whereby Rome and Persia made up their differences and arranged
to be friends on the following conditions: (1) Rome was to pay over
to Persia the sum of eleven thousand pounds of gold, or about half a
million of our money, as her contribution towards the maintenance of the
Caucasian defences, the actual defence being undertaken by Persia; (2)
Daras was to remain a fortified post, but was not to be made the Roman
head-quarters in Mesopotamia, which were to be fixed at Constantia;
(3) the district of Pharangium and the castle of Bolon, which Rome had
recently taken from Persia, were to be restored, and Persia on her part
was to surrender the forts which she had captured in Lazica; (4) Rome
and Persia were to be eternal friends and allies, and were to aid
each other whenever required with supplies of men and money. Thus was
terminated the thirty years' war, which, commencing in A.D. 502 by the
attack of Kobad on Annastasius, was brought to a close in A.D. 532, and
ratified by Justinian in the year following.
</p>
<p>
When Chosroes consented to substitute close relations of amity with Rome
for the hereditary enmity which had been the normal policy of his house,
he probably expected that no very striking or remarkable results would
follow. He supposed that the barbarian neighbors of the empire on the
north and on the west would give her arms sufficient employment, and
that the balance of power in Eastern Europe and Western Asia would
remain much as before. But in these expectations he was disappointed.
Justinian no sooner found his eastern frontier secure than he directed
the whole force of the empire upon his enemies in the regions of the
west, and in the course of half a dozen years (A.D. 533-539), by the
aid of his great general, Belisarius, he destroyed the kingdom of the
Vandals in the region about Carthage and Tunis, subdued the Moors,
and brought to its last gasp the power of the Ostrogoths in Italy. The
territorial extent of his kingdom was nearly doubled by these victories;
his resources were vastly increased; the prestige of his arms was
enormously raised; veteran armies had been formed which despised danger,
and only desired to be led against fresh enemies; and officers had been
trained capable of conducting operations of every kind, and confident,
under all circumstances, of success. It must have been with feelings
of dissatisfaction and alarm not easily to be dissembled that the Great
King heard of his brother's long series of victories and conquests, each
step in which constituted a fresh danger to Persia by aggrandizing the
power whom she had chiefly to fear. At first his annoyance found a vent
in insolent demands for a share of the Roman spoils, which Justinian
thought it prudent to humor but, as time went on, and the tide of
victory flowed more and more strongly in one direction, he became
less and less able to contain himself, and more and more determined to
renounce his treaty with Rome and renew the old struggle for supremacy.
His own inclination, a sufficiently strong motive in itself, was
seconded and intensified by applications made to him from without on the
part of those who had especial reasons for dreading the advance of Rome,
and for expecting to be among her next victims. Witiges, the Ostrogoth
king of Italy, and Bassaces, an Armenian chief, were the most important
of these applicants. Embassies from these opposite quarters reached
Chosroes in the same year, A.D. 539, and urged him for his own security
to declare war against Justinian before it was too late. "Justinian,"
the ambassadors said, "aimed at universal empire. His aspirations had
for a while been kept in check by Persia, and by Persia alone, the sole
power in the world that he feared. Since the 'endless peace' was made,
he had felt himself free to give full vent to his ambitious greed,
had commenced a course of aggression upon all the other conterminous
nations, and had spread war and confusion on all sides. He had destroyed
the kingdom of the Vandals in Africa, conquered the Moors, deceived the
Goths of Italy by professions of friendship, and then fallen upon them
with all his forces, violated the rights of Armenia and driven it to
rebellion, enslaved the Tzani and the Lazi, seized the Greek city
of Bosporus, and the 'Isle of Palms' on the shores of the Red Sea,
solicited the alliance of barbarous Huns and Ethiopians, striven to sow
discord between the Persian monarch and his vassals, and in every part
of the world shown himself equally grasping and restless. What would be
the consequence if Persia continued to hold aloof? Simply that all the
other nations would in turn be destroyed, and she would find herself
face to face with their destroyer, and would enjoy the poor satisfaction
of being devoured last. But did she fear to be reproached with breaking
the treaty and forfeiting her pledged word? Rome had already broken it
by her intrigues with the Huns, the Ethiopians, and the Saracens; and
Persia would therefore be free from reproach if she treated the peace
as no longer existing. The treaty-breaker is not he who first draws the
sword, but he who sets the example of seeking the other's hurt. Or did
Persia fear the result of declaring war? Such fear was unreasonable,
for Rome had neither troops, nor generals to oppose to a sudden Persian
attack. Sittas was dead; Belisarius and the best of the Roman forces
were in Italy. If Justinian recalled Belisarius, it was not certain that
he would obey; and, in the worst case, it would be in favor of Persia
that the Goths of Italy, and the Armenians who for centuries had been
subjects of Rome, were now ready to make common cause with her." Thus
urged, the Persian king determined on openly declaring war and making an
attack in force on the eastern provinces of the empire.
</p>
<p>
The scene of contest in the wars between Rome and Persia had been
usually either Mesopotamia or Armenia. On rare occasions only had the
traditional policy been departed from, and attempts made to penetrate
into the richer parts of the Roman East, and to inflict serious injury
on the empire by carrying fire and sword into peaceful and settled
provinces. Kobad, however, had in his later years ventured to introduce
a new system, and had sent troops across the Euphrates into Syria in
the hope of ravaging that fertile region and capturing its wealthy
metropolis, Antioch. This example Chosroes now determined to follow.
Crossing the great stream in the lower portion of its course, he led his
troops up its right bank, past Circesium, Zenobia, and Callinicus, to
Suron, a Roman town on the west side of the river. As this small place
ventured to resist him, Chosroes, bent upon terrifying the other towns
into submission, resolved to take a signal revenge. Though the garrison,
after losing their commandant, made overtures for a surrender, he
insisted on entering forcibly at one of the gates, and then, upon the
strength of this violent entrance, proceeded to treat the city as one
taken by storm, pillaged the houses, massacred a large portion of the
inhabitants, enslaved the others, and in conclusion set the place on
fire and burned it to the ground. It was perhaps in a fit of remorse,
though possibly only under the influence of greed, that shortly
afterwards he allowed the neighboring bishop of Sergiopolis to ransom
these unfortunate captives, twelve thousand, in number, for the modest
sum of two hundred pounds of gold.
</p>
<p>
From Suron the invading army advanced to Hierapolis, without
encountering the enemy, who did not dare to make any resistance in the
open field, but sought the protection of walls and strongholds. The
defences of Hierapolis were in tolerable order; its garrison was fairly
strong; and the Great King therefore prudently resolved to allow the
citizens to ransom themselves and their city at a moderate price. Two
thousand pounds of silver was the amount fixed upon; and this sum was
paid without any complaint by the Hierapolites. Plunder, not conquest,
was already distinctly set before the invader's mind as his aim; and
it is said that he even offered at this period to evacuate the Roman
territory altogether upon receiving a thousand pounds of gold. But
the Romans were not yet brought so low as to purchase a peace; it was
thought that Antioch and the other important towns might successfully
defy the Persian arms, and hoped that Justinian would soon send into
the field an army strong enough to cope with that of his adversary. The
terms, therefore, which Chosroes offered by the mouth of Megas, bishop
of Berhcea, were rejected; the Antiochenes were exhorted to remain firm;
Ephraim, the bishop, was denounced to the authorities for counselling
submission; and it was determined to make no pacific arrangement, but to
allow Chosroes to do his worst. The Persian, on his side, was not slack
or remiss. No sooner had he received the ransom of Hierapolis than
he advanced upon Berhoea (now Aleppo), which he reached in four days.
Observing that the defences were weak, he here demanded twice the ransom
that he had accepted from the Hierapolites, and was only induced to
forego the claim by the tears and entreaties of the good bishop, who
convinced him at length that the Berhoeans could not pay so large a sum,
and induced him to accept the half of it. A few more days' march brought
him from Aleppo to the outskirts of Antioch; and after an interval of
nearly three centuries the "Queen of the East," the richest and most
magnificent of Oriental cities, was once more invested by Persian troops
and threatened by a Sassanian monarch.
</p>
<p>
A great calamity had fallen upon Antioch only fourteen years previously.
The entire town had been ruined by a succession of terrible earthquakes,
which commenced in October, A.D. 525, and terminated in August of the
ensuing year. All for a time was havoc and disorder. A landslip had
covered a portion of the city, and in the remainder almost every house
was overthrown. But the liberality of Justinian, the spirit of the
inhabitants, and the efforts of the governor, had effaced these
disasters; and the city, when the Persians appeared before it, was in
most respects grander and more magnificent than ever. The defences were,
however, it would seem, imperfect. The citadel especially, which was
on the high ground south of the city, had been constructed with small
attention to the rules of engineering art, and was dominated by a height
at a little distance, which ought to have been included within the
walls. Nor was this deficiency compensated by any strength in the
garrison, or any weight of authority or talent among those with whom
rested the command. Justinian had originally sent his nephew, Germanus,
to conduct the defence of the Syrian capital, while Buzes, an officer
who had gained some repute in the Armenian war, was entrusted with
the general protection of the East until Belisarius should arrive from
Italy; but Germanus, after a brief stay, withdrew from Antioch into
Cilicia, and Buzes disappeared without any one knowing whither he had
betaken himself. Antioch was left almost without a garrison; and had
not Theoctistus and Molatzes, two officers who commanded in the
Lebanon, come to the rescue and brought with them a body of six thousand
disciplined troops, it is scarcely possible that any resistance should
have been made. As it was, the resistance was brief and ineffectual.
Chosroes at once discerned the weak point in the defences, and, having
given a general order to the less trusty of his troops to make attacks
upon the lower town in various places, himself with the flower of
the army undertook the assault upon the citadel. Here the commanding
position so unaccountably left outside the walls enabled the Persians to
engage the defenders almost on a level, and their superior skill in the
use of missile weapons soon brought the garrison into difficulties. The
assailants, however, might perhaps still have been repulsed, had not
an unlucky accident supervened, which, creating a panic, put it in the
power of the Persians by a bold movement to enter the place. The Romans,
cramped for room upon the walls, had extemporized some wooden stages
between the towers, which they hung outside by means of ropes. It
happened that, in the crush and tumult, one of these stages gave way;
the ropes broke, and the beams fell with a crash to the earth, carrying
with them a number of the defenders. The noise made by the fall was
great, and produced a general impression that the wall itself had been
broken down; the towers and battlements were at once deserted; the
Roman soldiers rushed to the gates and began to quit the town; while the
Persians took advantage of the panic to advance their scaling ladders,
to mount the walls, and to make themselves masters of the citadel. Thus
Antioch was taken. The prudence of Chosroes was shown in his quietly
allowing the armed force to withdraw; his resolve to trample down all
resistance appeared in his slaughter of the Antiochone youth, who with
a noble recklessness continued the conflict after the soldiers had fled;
his wish to inspire terror far and wide made him deliver the entire
city, with few exceptions, to the flames; while his avarice caused him
to plunder the churches, and to claim as his own the works of art, the
marbles, bronzes, tablets, and pictures, with which the Queen of
the Roman East was at this time abundantly provided. But, while thus
gratifying his most powerful passions, he did not lose sight of the
opportunity to conclude an advantageous peace. Justinian's ambassadors
had long been pressing him to come to terms with their master. He now
consented to declare the conditions on which he was ready to make peace
and withdraw his army. Rome must pay him, as an indemnity for the cost
of the war, the sum of five thousand pounds of gold, and must also
contract to make a further payment of five hundred pounds of gold
annually, not as a tribute, but as a fair contribution towards the
expense of maintaining the Caspian Gates and keeping out the Huns. If
hostages were given him, he would consent to abstain from further acts
of hostility while Justinian was consulted on these proposals, and would
even begin at once to withdraw his army. The ambassadors readily agreed
to these terms, and it was understood that a truce would be observed
until Justinian's answer should be delivered to Chosroes.
</p>
<p>
But the Great King, in thus formulating the terms on which he would be
content to make peace, did not intend to tie his own hands, or to allow
the Syrian cities before which he had not yet appeared to be quit of
him without the payment of ransom. After visiting Seleucia, the port of
Antioch at the mouth of the Orontes, bathing in the blue waters of the
Mediterranean, and offering sacrifice to the (setting?) sun upon the
shore, he announced his intention of proceeding to Apameia, a city
on the middle Orontes, which was celebrated for its wealth, and
particularly for its possession of a fragment of the "true cross,"
enshrined in a case which the pious zeal of the faithful had enriched
with gold and jewels of extraordinary value. Received peacefully into
the city by the submissive inhabitants, instead of fixing their ransom
at a definite sum, he demanded and obtained all the valuables of the
sacred treasury, including the precious relic which the Apamaeans
regarded as the most important of their possessions. As, however, it was
the case, and not its contents, that he coveted, while he carried off
the former, he readily restored the latter to the prayers of the bishop
and inhabitants.
</p>
<p>
From Apameia Chosroes returned to Antioch, and after witnessing the
games of the amphitheatre and securing victory to the green champion
because Justinian preferred the blue, he set out at last on his return
to Persia, taking care to visit, upon his way to the Euphrates, the city
of Chalcis, the only important place in Northern Syria that had hitherto
escaped him. The Chalcidians were required not only to ransom themselves
by a sum of money, but to give up to Chosroes the Roman soldiers who
garrisoned their town. By a perjury that may well be forgiven them,
they avoided the more important concession, but they had to satisfy the
avarice of the conqueror by the payment of two hundred pounds of gold.
The Persian host then continued its march, and reaching the Euphrates at
Obbane, in the neighborhood of Barbalissus, crossed by a bridge of boats
in three days. The object of Chosroes in thus changing his return line
of march was to continue in Roman Mesopotamia the course which he had
adopted in Syria since the conclusion of the truce&mdash;i.e. to increase his
spoil by making each important city ransom itself. Edessa, Constantina,
and Daras were successively visited, and purchased their safety by a
contribution. According to Procopius, the proceedings before Daras were
exceptional. Although Chosroes, before he quitted Edossa, had received a
communication from Justinian accepting the terms arranged with the Roman
envoys at Antioch, yet, when he reached Daras, he at once resolved upon
its siege. The city was defended by two walls, an outer one of moderate
strength, and an inner one sixty feet high, with towers at intervals,
whose height was a hundred feet. Chosroes, having invested the place,
endeavored to penetrate within the defences by means of a mine; but, his
design having been betrayed, the Romans met him with a countermine, and
completely foiled his enterprise. Unwilling to spend any more time on
the siege, the Persian monarch upon this desisted from his attempt, and
accepted the contribution of a thousand pounds of silver as a sufficient
redemption for the great fortress.
</p>
<p>
Such is the account of the matter given to us by Procopius, who is our
only extant authority for the details of this war. But the account is
violently improbable. It represents Chosroes as openly flying in the
face of a treaty the moment that he had concluded it, and as departing
in a single instance from the general tenor of his proceedings in all
other cases. In view of the great improbability of such a course of
action, it is perhaps allowable to suppose that Procopius has been for
once carried away by partisanship, and that the real difference between
the case of Daras and the other towns consisted in this, that Daras
alone refused to pay its ransom, and Chosroes had, in consequence, to
resort to hostilities in order to enforce it.
</p>
<p>
Still, no doubt, the whole conduct of Chosroes in enforcing ransoms
from the towns after the conclusion of the truce was open to serious
question, and Justinian was quite justified in treating his proceedings
as a violation of his recent engagements. It is not unlikely that, even
without any such excuse, he would shortly have renewed the struggle,
since the return of Belisarius in triumph from the Italian war had
placed at his service for employment in the East a general from whose
abilities much was naturally expected. As it was, Justinian was able, on
receiving intelligence of the fines levied on Apameia, Chalcis, Edessa,
Constantina, and Daras, and of the hostile acts committed against the
last-named place, with great show of reason and justice, to renounce the
recently concluded peace, and to throw on the ill faith of Chosroes the
blame of the rupture.
</p>
<p>
The Persian prince seems to have paid but little heed to the
denunciation. He passed the winter in building and beautifying a Persian
Antioch in the neighborhood of Ctesiphon, assigning it as a residence
to his Syrian captives, for whose use he constructed public baths and
a spacious hippodrome, where the entertainments familiar to them from
their youth were reproduced by Syrian artists. The new city was
exempt from the jurisdiction of Persian satraps, and was made directly
dependent upon the king, who supplied it with corn gratuitously, and
allowed it to become an inviolable asylum for all such Greek slaves as
should take shelter in it, and be acknowledged as their kinsmen by any
of the inhabitants. A model of Greek civilization was thus brought into
close contact with the Persian court, which could amuse itself with the
contrasts, if it did not learn much from the comparison, of European and
Asiatic manners and modes of thought.
</p>
<p>
The campaign of A.D. 540 was followed by one of a very different
character in A.D. 541. An unexpected offer suddenly made to the Persian
king drew him from his capital, together with the bulk of his troops, to
one of the remotest portions of the Persian territory, and allowed the
Romans, instead of standing on their defence, to assume an aggressive
in Mesopotamia, and even to retaliate the invasion which the year before
Chosroes had conducted into the heart of their empire. The hostile
operations of A.D. 541 had thus two distinct and far-distant scenes; in
the one set the Persians, in the other the Romans, took the offensive;
the two wars, for such they in reality were, scarcely affected one
another; and it will therefore be convenient to keep the accounts of
them distinct and separate. To commence with.
</p>
<p>
I. The LAZIO WAR.&mdash;Lazica had been a dependency of Rome from the time
when Tzath, upon his conversion to Christianity, professed himself the
vassal of Justin, and received the insignia of royalty from his new
patron (A.D. 522). The terms of the connection had been at the first
honorable to the weaker nation, which paid no tribute, admitted no
Roman garrison, and was troubled by no Roman governor. As time went
on, however, the Romans gradually encroached upon the rights of their
dependants; they seized and fortified a strong post, called Petra, upon
the coast, appointed a commandant who claimed an authority as great
as that of the Lazic king, and established a commercial monopoly which
pressed with great severity upon the poorer classes of the Lazi. Under
these circumstances the nation determined on revolt; and in the winter
of A.D. 540-1 Lazic ambassadors visited the court of Persia, exposed the
grievances of their countrymen, and besought Chosroes to accept their
submission, and extend to them the protection of his government. The
province was distant, and possessed few attractions; whatever the
tales told of its ancient wealth, or glories, or trade, in the time of
Chosroes it was poor and unproductive, dependent on its neighbors for
some of the necessaries and all the conveniences of life, and capable
of exporting nothing but timber, slaves, and skins. It might have been
expected, under such circumstances, that the burden of the protectorate
would have been refused; but there was an advantage, apparent or real,
in the position of the country, discovered by the sagacity of Chosroes
or suggested to him by the interested zeal of the envoys, which made its
possession seem to the Persian king a matter of the highest importance,
and induced him to accept the offer made him without a moment's delay.
Lazica, the ancient Colchis and the modern Mingrelia and Imeritia,
bordered upon the Black Sea, which the Persian dominions did not as yet
touch. Once in possesion of this tract, Chosroes conceived that he might
launch a fleet upon the Euxine, command its commerce, threaten or ravage
its shores, and even sail against Constantinople and besiege the Roman
emperor in his capital. The Persian king therefore acceded to the
request of the envoys, and, pretending to be called into Iberia by a
threatened invasion of the Huns, led a large army to the Lazic border,
was conducted into the heart of the country by the envoys, received the
submission of Gubazes, the king, and then, pressing on to the coast,
formed the siege of Petra, where the Roman forces were collected. Petra
offered a stout resistance, and repulsed more than one Persian assault;
but it was impossible for the small garrison to cope with the numbers,
the engineering skill, and the ardor of the assailants. After the loss
of their commandant, Johannes, and the fall of one of the principal
towers, the soldiers capitulated; Petra was made over to the Persians,
who restored and strengthened its defences, and Lazica became for the
time a Persian province.
</p>
<p>
II. The War in Mesopotamia.&mdash;Belisarius, on reaching the eastern
frontier, fixed his head-quarters at Daras, and, finding that the
Persians had no intention of invading Syria or Roman Mesopotamia,
resolved to lead his troops into the enemy's territory. As his forces
were weak in numbers, ill-armed, and ill-supplied, he could scarcely
hope to accomplish any great enterprise; but it was important to recover
the Roman prestige after the occurrences of the preceding year, and to
show that Rome was willing to encounter in the open field any force that
the Persians could bring against her. He therefore crossed the frontier
and advanced in the direction of Nisibis, less with the intention of
attacking the town than of distinctly offering battle to the troops
collected within it. His scheme succeeded; a small force, which he threw
out in advance, drew the enemy from the walls; and their pursuit of
this detachment brought them into contact with the main army of
Belisarius, which repulsed them and sent them flying into the town.
Having thus established his superiority in the field, the Roman general,
though he could not attack Nisibis with any prospect of success, was
able to adopt other offensive measures. He advanced in person a day's
march beyond Nisibis, and captured the fort of Sisauranon. Eight hundred
Persian cavalry of the first class were made prisoners, and sent by
Belisarius to Byzantium, where they were despatched by Justinian to
Italy, where they served against the Goths. Arethas, the chief of the
Saracens who fought on the side of Rome, was sent still further in
advance. The orders given him were to cross the Tigris into Assyria, and
begin to ravage it, but to return within a short time to the camp, and
bring a report of the strength of the Persians beyond the river. If the
report was favorable, Belisarius intended to quit Mesopotamia, and take
the whole Roman force with him into Assyria. His plans, however,
were frustrated by the selfish Arab, who, wishing to obtain the whole
Assyrian spoil for himself, dismissed his Roman troops, proceeded to
plunder the rich province on his own account, and sent Belisarius no
intelligence of what he was so doing. After waiting at Sisauranon
till the heats of summer had decimated his army, the Roman general
was compelled to retreat by the discontent of the soldiery and the
representations of his principal officers. He withdrew his forces within
the Roman frontier without molestation from the enemy, and was shortly
afterwards summoned to Constantinople to confer on the state of affairs
with, the emperor.
</p>
<p>
The military operations of the next year (A.D. 542) were comparatively
unimportant. Chosroes collected a large army, and, repeating the
movement of A.D. 540, made his appearance in Commagene early in the
year, intending to press forward through Syria into Palestine, and
hoping to make himself master of the sacred treasures which he knew to
be accumulated in the Holy City of Jerusalem. He found the provincial
commanders, Buzes and Justus, despondent and unenterprising, declined
to meet him in the field, and content to remain shut up within the walls
of Hierapolis. Had these been his only opponents the campaign would
probably have proved a success; but, at the first news of his invasion,
Justinian despatched Belisarius to the East, for the second time,
and this able general, by his arts or by his reputation, succeeded
in arresting the steps of Chosroes and frustrating his expedition.
Belisarius took up his head-quarters at Europus, on the Euphrates, a
little to the south of Zeugma, and, spreading his troops on both
banks of the river, appeared both to protect the Roman province and to
threaten the return of the enemy. Chosroes having sent an emissary to
the Roman camp under the pretence of negotiating, but really to act the
part of a spy, was so impressed (if we may believe Procopius) by the
accounts which he received of the ability of the general and the
warlike qualities of his soldiers, that he gave up the idea of advancing
further, and was content to retire through Roman Mesopotamia into his
own territories. He is said even to have made a convention that he would
commit no hostile act as he passed through the Roman province; but if
so, he did not keep the engagement. The city of Callinicus lay in his
way; its defences were undergoing repairs, and there was actually a gap
in one place where the old wall had been pulled down and the new one had
not yet been built. The Persian king could not resist the temptation
of seizing this easy prey; he entered the undefended town, enslaved all
whom he found in it, and then razed the place to the ground. Such is
the account which the Byzantine historian gives of the third campaign
of Chosroes against the Romans, and of the motive and manner of his
retreat. Without taxing him with falsehood, we may suspect that, for the
glorification of his favorite hero, he has kept back a portion of the
truth. The retreat of Chosroes may be ascribed with much probability to
the advance of another danger, more formidable than Belisarius, which
exactly at this time made its appearance in the country whereto he was
hastening. It was in the summer of A.D. 542 that the plague broke out at
Pelusium, and spread from that centre rapidly into the rest of Egypt and
also into Palestine. Chosroes may well have hesitated to confront this
terrible foe. He did not ultimately escape it; but he might hope to
do so, and it would clearly have been the height of imprudence to have
carried out his intention of invading Palestine when the plague was
known to be raging there.
</p>
<p>
The fourth year of the Roman war (A.D. 543) opened with a movement of
the Persian troops toward the Armenian frontier, consequent upon the
desertion of the Persian cause by the Roman Armenians in the course of
the winter. Chosroes in person once more led the attack, and proceeded
as far as Azerbijan; but, the pestilence breaking out in his army, he
hastily retreated, after some futile attempts at negotiation with the
Roman officers opposed to him. Belisarius had this year been sent to
Italy, and the Roman army of the East, amounting to thirty thousand
men, was commanded by as many as fifteen generals, almost of equal rank,
among whom there was little concert or agreement. Induced to take
the offensive by the retirement of the Persian king, these incapable
officers invaded Persarmenia with all their troops, and proceeded to
plunder its rich plains and fertile valleys. Encountering suddenly and
unexpectedly the Persian general Nabedes, who, with a small force,
was strongly posted at a village called Anglon, they were compelled to
engage at disadvantage; their troops, entangled in difficult ground,
found themselves attacked in their rear by an ambush; Narses, the
bravest of them, fell; and, a general panic seizing the entire
multitude, they fled in the extremest disorder, casting away their
arms, and pressing their horses till they sank and expired. The Persians
pursued, but with caution, and the carnage was not so great as might
have been expected; but vast numbers of the disarmed fugitives were
overtaken and made prisoners by the enemy; and the arms, animals,
and camp equipment which fell into the hands of the Persians amply
compensated all previous losses, and left Persarmenia the richer for the
inroad.
</p>
<p>
The ravages of the pestilence having ceased, Chosroes, in the following
year (A.D. 544), again marched westward in person, and laid siege to the
city of Edessa. It would seem that he had now resolved not to be content
with plundering raids, but to attempt at any rate the permanent conquest
of some portion of the Roman territory. Edessa and Daras were the two
towns on which the Roman possession of Western Mesopotamia at this time
mainly depended. As the passing of Nisibis, in A.D. 363, from Roman into
Persian hands, had given to Persia a secure hold on the eastern portion
of the country between the rivers, so the occupation of Edessa and Daras
could it have been effected, would have carried with it dominion over
the more western regions. The Roman frontier would in this way have been
thrown back to the Euphrates. Chosroes must be understood as aiming at
this grand result in the siege which he so pertinaciously pressed, and
which Edessa so gallantly resisted, during the summer of A.D. 544. The
elaborate account which Procopius gives of the siege may be due to a
sense of its importance. Chosroes tried, not force only, but every art
known to the engineering science of the period; he repeated his assaults
day after day; he allowed the defenders no repose; yet he was compelled
at last to own himself baffled by the valor of the small Roman garrison
and the spirit of the native inhabitants, to burn his works, and to
return home. The five hundred pounds of gold which he extorted at last
from Martinus, the commandant of the place, may have been a salve to
his wounded pride; but it was a poor set-off against the loss of men, of
stores, and of prestige, which he had incurred by his enterprise.
</p>
<p>
It was, perhaps, his repulse from the walls of Edessa that induced
Chosroes, in A.D. 545, seriously to entertain the proposals for an
arrangement which were made to him by the ambassadors of Justinian.
Throughout the war their had been continual negotiations; but hitherto
the Persian king had trifled with his antagonist, and had amused himself
with discussing terms of accommodation without any serious purpose.
Now at last, after five years of incessant hostilities, in which he
had gained much glory but little profit, he seems to have desired a
breathing-space. Justinian's envoys visited him at Ctesiphon, and
set forth their master's desire to conclude a regular peace. Chosroes
professed to think that the way for a final arrangement would be best
prepared by the conclusion, in the first instance, of a truce. He
proposed, in lieu of a peace, a cessation of hostilities for five years,
during the course of which the causes of quarrel between the two nations
might be considered, and a good understanding established. It shows the
weakness of the Empire, that Justinian not only accepted this proposal,
but was content to pay for the boon granted him. Chosroes received as
the price of the five years truce the services of a Greek physician and
two thousand pounds of gold.
</p>
<p>
The five years' truce seems to have been observed with better faith
by the Persian than by the Roman monarch. Alamundarus indeed, though
a Persian vassal, regarded himself as entitled, despite the truce, to
pursue his quarrel with his natural enemy, Arethas, who acknowledged the
suzerainty of Rome; but Chosroes is not even accused of instigating
his proceedings; and the war between the vassals was carried on without
dragging either of the two lords-paramount into its vortex. Thus far,
then, neither side had any cause of complaint against the other. If we
were bound to accept the Roman story of a project formed by Chosroes
for the surprise and seizure of Daras, we should have to admit that
circumstances rather than his own will saved the Persian monarch from
the guilt of being the first to break the agreement. But the tale told
by Procopius is improbable; and the Roman belief of it can have rested
at best only upon suspicion. Chosroes, it is allowed, committed no
hostile act; and it may well be doubted whether he really entertained
the design ascribed to him. At any rate, the design was not executed,
nor even attempted; and the peace was thus not broken on his part.
It was reserved for Rome in the fourth year of the truce (A.D. 549)
expressly, to break its provisions by accepting the Lazi into alliance
and sending them a body of eight thousand men to help them against the
Persians.
</p>
<p>
Very soon after their submission to Persia the Lazi had repented of
their rash and hasty action. They found that they had gained nothing,
while in some respects they had lost, by their change of masters.
The general system of the Persian administration was as arbitrary and
oppressive as the Roman. If the commercial monopoly, whereof they so
bitterly complained, had been swept away, commerce itself had gone with
it, and they could neither find a market for their own products, nor
obtain the commodities which they required. The Persian manners and
customs introduced into their country, if not imposed upon themselves,
were detestable to the Lazi, who were zealous and devout Christians,
and possessed by the spirit of intolerance. Chosroes, after holding the
territory for a few years, became convinced that Persia could not
retain it unless the disaffected population were removed and replaced
by faithful subjects. He designed therefore, we are told, to deport
the entire Lazic nation, and to plant the territory with colonies of
Persians and others, on whose fidelity he could place full reliance.
As a preliminary step, he suggested to his lieutenant in Lazica that he
should contrive the assassination of Gubazes, the Lazic king, in whom
he saw an obstacle to his project. Phabrizus, however, failed in his
attempt to execute this commission; and his failure naturally produced
the immediate revolt of the province, which threw itself once more into
the arms of Rome, and, despite the existing treaty with the Persians,
was taken by Justinian under his protection.
</p>
<p>
The Lazic war, which commenced in consequence of this act of
Justinian's, continued almost without intermission for nine years&mdash;from
A.D. 549 to 557. Its details are related at great length by Procopius
and Agathias, who view the struggle as one which vitally concerned the
interests of their country. According to them, Chosroes was bent upon
holding Lazica in order to construct at the mouth of the Phasis a great
naval station and arsenal, from which his fleets might issue to command
the commerce or ravage the shores of the Black Sea. There is no doubt
that the country was eminently fitted for such a purpose. The soil is
for the most part richly fertile; the hills are everywhere covered with
forests of noble trees; the Rion (Phasis) is deep and broad towards its
mouth; and there are other streams also which are navigable. If Chosroes
entertained the intentions ascribed to him, and had even begun the
collection of timber for ship-building at Petra on the Euxine as early
as A.D. 549, we cannot be surprised at the attitude assumed by Rome, or
at her persistent efforts to recover possession of the Lazic territory.
</p>
<p>
The war was opened by an attack upon the great centre of the Persian
power, Petra. This place, which was strongly situated on a craggy rock
projecting into the sea, had been carefully fortified by Justinian
before Lazica passed into the possession of Chosroes, and had since
received important additions to its defences at the hands of the
Persians. It was sufficiently provisioned, and was defended by a body of
fifteen hundred men. Dagisthseus, the Roman commander, besieged it with
his entire force of eight thousand men, and succeeded by his constant
attacks in reducing the garrison to little more than a fourth of its
original number. Baffled in one attempt to effect a breach by means of
a mine, he had contrived to construct another, and might have withdrawn
his props, destroyed the wall, and entered the place, had he not
conceived the idea of bargaining with the emperor for a specific reward
in case he effected the capture. Whilst he waited for his messenger to
bring a reply, the Persian general, Memeroes, forced the passes from
Iberia into Lazica, and descended the valley of the Phasis with an army
of 30,000 men. Dagisthalus in alarm withdrew, and Petra was relieved
and revictualled. The walls were repaired hastily with sandbags, and
the further defence was entrusted to a fresh garrison of 3000 picked
soldiers. Mermeroes then, finding it difficult to obtain supplies for
his large army, retired into Persarmenia, leaving only five thousand
Persians in the country besides the garrison of Petra. This small force
was soon afterwards surprised by the combined Romans and Lazi, who
completely defeated it, destroying or making prisoners almost the entire
number.
</p>
<p>
In the ensuing year, A.D. 550, the Persians took the field under a fresh
general, Chorianes, who brought with him a considerable army, composed
of Persians and Alans. The allied Romans and Lazi, under Dagisthseus
and Gubazes, gave battle to this new foe on the banks of the Hippis (the
Tschenikal?); and though the Lazi, who had insisted on taking the lead
and fighting separately, were at the first encounter routed by the
Persian horse, yet in the end Roman discipline and stubbornness
triumphed. Their solid line of footmen, bristling with spears, offered
an impervious barrier to the cavalry of the enemy, which did not dare
to charge, but had recourse to volleys of missiles. The Romans responded
with the same; and the battle raged for a while on something like even
terms, the superior rapidity of the Asiatics being counterbalanced by
the better protection which their shields gave to the Europeans, until
at last, by a stroke of fortune, Rome obtained the victory. A chance
arrow killed Chorianes, and his army instantly fled. There was a short
struggle at the Persian camp; but the Romans and Lazi captured it. Most
of the Persians were here put to the sword; the few who escaped quitted
Lazica and returned to their own country.
</p>
<p>
Soon afterwards Dagisthseus was superseded by Bessas, and the siege of
Petra was recommenced. The strength of the place had been considerably
increased since the former attack upon it. A new wall of great height
and solidity had been built upon a framework of wood in the place which
Dagisthaeus had so nearly breached; the Roman mines had been filled
up with gravel; arms, offensive and defensive, had been collected in
extraordinary abundance; a stock of flour and of salted meat had been
laid in sufficient to support the garrison of 3000 men for five years;
and a store of vinegar, and of the pulse from which it was made, had
likewise been accumulated. The Roman general began by attempting to
repeat the device of his predecessor, attacking the defences in the same
place and by the same means; but, just as his mine was completed, the
new wall with its framework of wood sank quietly into the excavation,
without suffering any disturbance of its parts, while enough of it still
remained above the surface to offer an effectual bar to the assailants.
It seemed hopeless to recommence the mine in this place, and elsewhere
the nature of the ground made mining impossible; some other mode
of attack had therefore to be adopted, or the siege must have been
abandoned. Rome generally took towns by the battering-ram; but the
engines in use were of such heavy construction that they could not be
dragged up an ascent like that upon which Petra stood. Bessas was in
extreme perplexity, when some Hunnic allies, who happened to be in
his camp, suggested a mode of constructing a ram, as effective as the
ordinary one, which should nevertheless be so light that it could be
carried on the shoulders of forty men. Three such machines were quickly
made; and under their blows the wall would soon have given way, had
not the defenders employed against them the terrible agency of fire,
showering upon them from the walls lighted casks of sulphur, bitumen,
and naphtha, which last was known to the Greeks of Colchis as "Medea's
oil." Uncertain of succeeding in this attack, the Roman general
gallantly led a scaling party to another portion of the walls, and,
mounting at the head of his men, attempted to make good his footing on
the battlements. Thrown headlong to the ground, but undeterred by his
fall, he was about to repeat his attempt, when he found it needless.
Almost simultaneously his troops had in two other places penetrated into
the town. One band had obtained an entrance by scaling the rocks in
a place supposed to be inaccessible; a second owed its success to a
combination of accidents. First, it had happened that a gap had shown
itself in the piece of the wall which sank into the Roman mine, and a
violent struggle had ensued between the assailants and defenders at this
place.
</p>
<p>
Then, while this fight was going on, the fire which the Persians were
using against the Roman battering-rams had been by a shift of wind blown
back upon themselves, and the wooden structure from which they fought
had been ignited, and in a short time entirely consumed, together with
its inmates. At sight of the conflagration, the Persians who stood in
the gap had lost heart, and had allowed the Roman troops to force their
way through it into Petra. Thus fell the great Lazic fortress, after a
resistance which is among the most memorable in history. Of the three
thousand defenders, seven hundred had been killed in the siege; one
thousand and seventy were destroyed in the last assault. Only seven
hundred and thirty were made prisoners; and of these no fewer than seven
hundred and twelve were found to be wounded. The remaining five hundred
threw themselves into the citadel, and there resisted to the last
extremity, refusing all terms of capitulation, and maintaining
themselves against an overwhelming force, until at last by sword and
fire they perished to a man.
</p>
<p>
The siege of Petra was prolonged far into the winter, and the year A.D.
551 had begun ere the resistance ceased. Could the gallant defenders
have maintained themselves for a few more weeks, they might not
improbably have triumphed. Mermeroes, the Persian commander of two years
previously, took the field with the commencement of spring, and, at the
head of a large body of cavalry, supported by eight elephants, began
his march to the coast, hoping to relieve the beleaguered garrison.
Unfortunately he was too late. On his march he heard of the capture of
Petra, and of its complete destruction by Bessas, who feared lest
the Persians should again occupy the dangerous post. Mermeroes had no
difficulty in establishing Persian rule through almost the whole of
Lazica. The Romans did not dare to meet him in the field. Archssopolis,
indeed, repulsed his attack; but no other important place in the entire
country remained subject to the Empire. Qubazes and his followers had to
hide themselves in the recesses of the mountains. Quartering his
troops chiefly on the upper Phasis, about Kutais and its neighborhood,
Mermeroes strengthened his hold on the country by building forts or
receiving their submission, and even extended the Persian dominion
beyond Lazica into Scymnia and Suania. Still Rome, with her usual
tenacity, maintained a hold upon certain tracts; and Gubazes, faithful
to his allies even in the extremity of their depression, maintained a
guerilla war, and hoped that some day fortune would cease to frown on
him.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, at Byzantium, fresh negotiations were in progress, and hopes
were entertained of an arrangement by which all the differences between
the two great powers would be satisfactorily adjusted. Isdigunas
again represented his master at the Byzantine court, and conducted the
diplomatic contest with skill and ability. Taxing Justinian with more
than one infraction of the truce concluded in A.D. 545, he demanded the
payment of a lump sum of two thousand six hundred pounds of gold, and
expressed the willingness of Chosroes to conclude on these terms a fresh
truce for five years, to take effect from the delivery of the money.
With regard to the extent of country whereto the truce should apply, he
agreed to an express limitation of its range&mdash;the settled provinces of
both empires should be protected by it, but Lazica and the country of
the Saracens should be excluded from its operation. Justinian consented
to these terms, despite the opposition of many of his subjects, who
thought that Rome degraded herself by her repeated payments of money
to Persia, and accepted a position little better than that of a Persian
tributary.
</p>
<p>
Thus the peace of A.D. 551 did nothing towards ending the Lazic war,
which, after languishing through the whole of A.D. burst out again with
renewed vigor in the spring of A.D. 553. Mermeroes in that year advanced
from Kutais against Telephis, a strong fort in the possession of Rome,
expelled the commandant, Martinus, by a stratagem, pressed forward
against the combined Roman forces, which fled before him from Ollaria,
and finally drove them to the coast and cooped them up in "the Island,"
a small tract near the mouth of the Phasis between that stream and the
Doconus. On his return he was able to reinforce a garrison which he had
established at Onoguris in the immediate neighborhood of Archseopolis,
as a means of annoying and weakening that important station. He may
naturally have hoped in one or two more campaigns to have driven the
last Roman out of the country and to have attached Lazica permanently
to the empire of the great king.
</p>
<p>
Unluckily, however, for Persia, the fatigues which the gallant veteran
had undergone in the campaign of A.D. 553 proved more than his aged
frame could endure, and he had scarcely reached Kutais when he was
seized with a fatal malady, to which he succumbed in the course of the
winter. Chosroes appointed as his successor a certain Nachoragan, who
is said to have been a general of repute, but who proved himself quite
unequal to the position which he was called upon to fill, and in the
course of two years ruined the Persian cause in Lazica. The failure
was the more signal from the fact that exactly at the time of his
appointment circumstances occurred which seriously shook the Roman
influence over the Lazi, and opened a prospect to Persia transcending
aught that she could reasonably have hoped. This was nothing less than
a most serious quarrel between Gubazes, the Lazic king, and some of the
principal Roman commanders&mdash;a quarrel which involved consequences fatal
to both parties. Gubazes, disgusted with the negligence or incapacity
of the Roman chiefs, had made complaint of them to Justinian; they had
retaliated by accusing him of meditating desertion, and had obtained
the emperor's consent to his arrest, and to the use of violence if he
offered resistance. Armed with this mandate, they contrived in a little
time to fasten a quarrel upon him; and, when he declined to do as they
required, they drew their swords upon him and slew him. The Lazic nation
was, naturally enough, alienated by this outrage, and manifested an
inclination to throw itself absolutely into the arms of Persia. The
Romans, dispirited at the attitude of their allies, and at variance
among themselves, could for some months after Gubazes' death have
offered but little resistance to an enterprising enemy. So demoralized
were they that an army of 50,000 is said to have fled in dismay when
attacked by a force of Persians less than a twelfth of their number,
and to have allowed their camp to be captured and plundered. During
this critical time Nachoragan remained inactive in Iberia, and contented
himself with sending messengers into Lazica to announce his near
approach and to animate and encourage his party. The result was such as
might have been expected. The Lazi, finding that Persia made no effort
to take advantage of their abstention, and that Rome despite of it
maintained possession of the greater portion of their country, came to
the conclusion that it would be unwise to desert their natural allies
on account of a single outrage, however monstrous, and agreed to renew
their close alliance with Rome on condition that the murderers of
Gubazes should be punished, and his brother, Tzathes, appointed king in
his place. Justinian readily gave his consent; and the year A.D. 555 saw
the quarrel ended, and the Lazi once more heartily in accord with, their
Roman protectors.
</p>
<p>
It was when affairs were in this state, and he had exactly missed his
opportunity, that Nachoragan took the field, and, advancing from Iberia
into the region about Kutai's with an army amounting to 60,000 men,1
made preparations for carrying on the war with vigor. He was opposed by
Martinus, Justin, and Babas, the two former of whom with the bulk of
the Roman forces occupied the region on the lower Phasis, known as "the
Island," while Babas held the more central position of Archseopolis.
Nachoragan, after losing about 2,000 of his best troops in the vicinity
of this last-named place, resolved to challenge the Romans to a decisive
encounter by attacking the important post of Phasis at the mouth of the
river. With some skill he succeeded in passing the Roman camp on the
island, and in establishing himself in the plain directly south of
Phasis before the Roman generals guessed his purpose. They, however,
were able by a quick movement to throw themselves into the town, and the
struggle became one between fairly balanced forces, and was conducted
with great obstinacy. The town was defended on the south by an outer
palisade, a broad ditch protected by sharp stakes and full of water, and
an inner bulwark of considerable height but constructed wholly of wood.
The Phasis guarded it on the north; and here a Roman fleet was stationed
which lent its aid to the defenders at the two extremities of their
line. The yards of the ships were manned with soldiers, and boats
were hung from them containing slingers, archers, and even workers of
catapults, who delivered their weapons from an elevation exceeding that
of the towers. But Nachoragan had the advantage of numbers; his men soon
succeeded in filling up part of the ditch; and the wooden bulwark could
scarcely have long resisted his attacks, if the contest had continued
to be wholly one of brute strength. But the Roman commander, Martinus,
finding himself inferior in force, brought finesse and stratagem to his
aid. Pretending to receive intelligence of the sudden arrival of a fresh
Roman army from Byzantium, he contrived that the report should reach
Nachoragan and thereby cause him to divide his troops, and send half of
them to meet the supposed reinforcements. Then, when the Persian general
nevertheless renewed his assault, Martinus sent secretly 5,000 men under
Justin to a short distance from Phasis; and this detachment, appearing
suddenly when the contest was going on at the wall, was naturally taken
for the newly arrived army, and caused a general panic. The Persians,
one and all, took to flight; a general sally was made by the Romans in
Phasis; a rout and a carnage followed, which completely disheartened
the Persian leader, and led him to give up his enterprise. Having lost
nearly one-fourth of his army, Nachoragan drew off to Kutai's, and
shortly afterwards, leaving the command of the Persians in Lazica to
Vaphrizes, retired to winter quarters in Iberia.
</p>
<p>
The failure of Nachoragan, following closely upon the decision of the
Lazi to maintain their alliance with Rome in spite of the murder
of Gubazes, seems to have convinced the Persian monarch that, in
endeavoring to annex Lazica, he had engaged in a hopeless enterprise,
and that it would be the most prudent and judicious course to yield
to the inevitable, and gradually withdraw from a position which was
untenable. Having meted out to Nachoragan the punishment usually
assigned to unsuccessful commanders in Persia, he sent an ambassador to
Byzantium in the spring of A.D. 556, and commenced negotiations which
he intended to be serious. Diplomacy seems to have been as averse in the
days of Chosroes as in our own to an undignified rapidity of proceeding.
Hence, though there could be little to debate where both parties were
substantially at one, the negotiations begun in May A.D. 556 were not
concluded till after the commencement of the following year. A complete
suspension of hostilities was then agreed upon, to extend to Lazica no
less than to the other dominions of the two monarchs. In Lazica each
party was to keep what it possessed, territory, cities, and castles. As
this joint occupation was scarcely suitable for a permanent arrangement,
it was provided that the two belligerents should, during the continuance
of the truce, proceed to settle the terms on which a lasting peace might
be established.
</p>
<p>
An interval of five years elapsed before the happy result, for which
both parties had expressed themselves anxious, was accomplished. It is
uncertain how Chosroes was occupied during this period; but there are
some grounds for believing that he was engaged in the series of Oriental
wars whereof we shall have to speak presently. Success appears to have
crowned his arms wherever he directed them; but he remained undazzled by
his victories, and still retained the spirit of moderation which had
led him in A.D. 557 to conclude the general truce. He was even prepared,
after five years of consideration, to go further in the line of pacific
policy on which he had then entered, and, in order to secure the
continuance of his good relations with Rome, was willing to relinquish
all claim to the sovereignty of Lazica. Under these circumstances,
ambassadors of the highest rank, representing the two powers, met on the
frontier between Daras and Nisibis, proclaimed the power and explained
the motives of their respective sovereigns, and after a lengthy
conference formulated a treaty of peace. The terms, which are given
at length by a writer of the succeeding generation, may be briefly
expressed as follows: (1) the Persians were to withdraw from Lazica, to
give up all claim to it, and to hand over its possession to the Romans;
(2) they were in return to receive from Rome an annual sum of 30,000
pieces of gold, the amount due for the first seven years being paid in
advance; (3) the Christians in Persia were guaranteed the full and free
exercise of their religion, but were forbidden to make converts from
the disciples of Zoroaster; (4) commercial intercourse was to be allowed
between the two empires, but the merchants were restricted to the use of
certain roads and certain emporia; (5) diplomatic intercourse was to be
wholly free, and the goods of ambassadors were to be exempt from duty;
(6) Daras was to continue a fortified town, but no new fortresses were
to be built upon the frontier by either nation, and Daras itself was not
to be made the headquarters of the Prefect of the East, or to be held
by an unnecessarily large garrison; (7) all disputes arising between
the two nations were to be determined by courts of arbitration; (8)
the allies of the two nations were to be included in the treaty, and to
participate in its benefits and obligations; (9) Persia was to undertake
the sole charge of maintaining the Caspian Gates against the Huns and
Alans; (10) the peace was made for a period of fifty years. It has been
held that by this treaty Justinian consented to become a tributary of
the Persian Empire; and undoubtedly it was possible for Oriental vanity
to represent the arrangement made in this light. But the million and a
half, which Rome undertook to pay in the course of the next fifty years,
might well be viewed by the Romans as an outlay for which they received
an ample return in the cession to them of the Persian part of Lazica,
and in the termination of their obligation to contribute towards the
maintenance of the Caspian Gates. If there was any real danger of those
results following from the Persian occupation of Lazica which both
nations anticipated, the sum must be considered to have been one of the
best investments ever made by a State. Even if we believe the dangers
apprehended to have been visionary, yet it cannot be viewed as an
exorbitant price to have paid for a considerable tract of fertile
country, a number of strong fortresses, and the redemption of an
obligation which could not with honor be disowned.
</p>
<p>
To Chosroes the advantage secured by the treaty was similar to that
which Rome had obtained by the peace of A.D. 532. Being no longer
under any necessity of employing his forces against the Romans in the
north-west, he found himself free to act with greatly increased effect
against his enemies in the east and in the south. Already, in the
interval between the conclusion of the general truce and of the fifty
years' peace, he had, as it seems, invaded the territories of the
Ephthalites, and, with the help of the Great Khan of the Turks,
inflicted upon this people, so long one of Persia's most formidable
enemies, a severe defeat. According to Tabari, he actually slew the
Ephthalite monarch, ravaged his territory, and pillaged his treasures.
About the same time he had also had a war with the Khazars, had overrun
their country, wasted it with fire and sword, and massacred thousands of
the inhabitants. He now entertained designs against Arabia and perhaps
India, countries on which he could not hope to make an impression
without earnest and concentrated effort. It was doubtless with the view
of extending his influence into these quarters that the Persian monarch
evacuated Lazica, and bound his country to maintain peace with Rome for
the next half-century.
</p>
<p>
The position of affairs in Arabia was at the time abnormal and
interesting. For the most part that vast but sterile region has been the
home of almost countless tribes, living independently of one another,
each under its own sheikh or chief, in wild and unrestrained freedom.
Native princes have seldom obtained any widely extended dominion over
the scattered population; and foreign powers have still more rarely
exercised authority for any considerable period over the freedom-loving
descendants of Ishmael. But towards the beginning of the sixth century
of our era the Abyssinians of Axum, a Christian people, "raised" far
"above the ordinary level of African barbarism" by their religion and
by their constant intercourse with Rome, succeeded in attaching to their
empire a large portion of the Happy Arabia, and ruled it at first from
their African capital, but afterwards by means of a viceroy, whose
dependence on the Negus of Abyssinia was little more than nominal.
Abraha, an Abyssinian of high rank, being deputed by the Negus to
re-establish the authority of Abyssinia over the Yemen when it was
shaken by a great revolt, made himself master of the country, assumed
the crown, established Abyssinians in all the chief cities, built
numerous churches, especially one of great beauty at Sana, and at
his death left the kingdom to his eldest son, Yaksoum. An important
Christian state was thus established in the Great Peninsula; and it was
natural that Justinian should see with satisfaction, and Chosroes with
some alarm, the growth of a power in this quarter which was sure to side
with Rome and against Persia, if their rivalry should extend into
these parts. Justinian had hailed with pleasure the original Abyssinian
conquest, and had entered into amicable relations with both the Axumites
and their colonists in the Yemen. Chosroes now resolved upon a counter
movement. He would employ the quiet secured to him by the peace of A.D.
562 in a great attack upon the Abyssinian power in Arabia. He would
drive the audacious Africans from the soil of Asia, and would earn the
eternal gratitude of the numerous tribes of the desert. He would extend
Persian influence to the shores of the Arabian Gulf, and so confront the
Romans along the whole line of their eastern boundary. He would destroy
the <i>point d'appui</i> which Rome had acquired in South-western Asia, and
so at once diminish her power and augment the strength and glory of
Persia.
</p>
<p>
The interference of Chosroes in the affairs of a country so distant as
Western Arabia involved considerable difficulties; but his expedition
was facilitated by an application which he received from a native of the
district in question. Saif, the son of Dsu-Yezm, descended from the race
of the old Homerite kings whom the Abyssinians had conquered, grew up at
the court of Abraha in the belief that that prince, who had married his
mother, was not his step-father, but his father. Undeceived by an insult
which Masrouq, the true son of Abraha and successor of Yaksoum, offered
him, Saif became a refugee at the court of Chosroes, and importuned the
Great King to embrace his quarrel and reinstate him on the throne of
his fathers. He represented the Homerite population of Yemen as groaning
under the yoke of their oppressors and only waiting for an opportunity
to rise in revolt and shake it off. A few thousand Persian troops,
enough to form the nucleus of an army, would suffice; they might be sent
by sea to the port of Aden, near the mouth of the Arabian Gulf, where
the Homerites would join them in large numbers; the combined forces
might then engage in combat with the Abyssinians, and destroy them or
drive them from the land. Chosroes took the advice tendered him, so far
at any rate as to make his expedition by sea. His ships were assembled
in the Persian Gulf; a certain number of Persian troops were embarked on
board them; and the flotilla proceeded, under the conduct of Saif, first
to the mouth of the Gulf, and then along the southern coast of Arabia
to Aden. Encouraged by their presence, the Plomerites rose against their
foreign oppressors; a war followed, of which the particulars have been
disfigured by romance; but the result is undoubted&mdash;the Abyssinian
strangers were driven from the soil of Arabia; the native race recovered
its supremacy; and Saif, the descendant of the old Homerite kings, was
established, as the vassal or viceroy of Chosroes, on the throne of his
ancestors. This arrangement, however, was not lasting. Saif, after a
short reign, was murdered by his body-guard; and Chosroes then conferred
the government of Yemen upon a Persian officer, who seems to have borne
the usual title of Marzpan, and to have been in no way distinguished
above other rulers of provinces. Thus the Homerites in the end gained
nothing by their revolt but a change of masters. They may, however, have
regarded the change as one worth making, since it gave them the mild
sway of a tolerant heathen in lieu of the persecuting rule of Christian
bigots.
</p>
<p>
According to some writers, Chosroes also, in his later years, sent an
expedition by sea against some portion of Hindustan, and received a
cession of territory from an Indian monarch. But the country of the
monarch is too remote for belief, and the ceded provinces seem to have
belonged to Persia previously. It is therefore, perhaps, most probable
that friendly intercourse has been exaggerated into conquest, and the
reception of presents from an Indian potentate metamorphosed into the
gain of territory. Some authorities do not assign to Chosroes any Indian
dominion; and it is at least doubtful whether he made any expedition in
this direction.
</p>
<p>
A war, however, appears certainly to have occupied Chosroes about
this period on his north-eastern frontier. The Turks had recently been
advancing in strength and drawing nearer to the confines of Persia. They
had extended their dominion over the great Ephthalite kingdom, partly by
force of arms, partly through the treachery of Katulphus, an Ephthalite
chieftain; they had received the submission of the Sogdians, and
probably of other tribes of the Transoxianian region, previously held in
subjection by the Ephthalites; and they aspired to be acknowledged as a
great power, the second, if not the first, in this part of Asia. It was
perhaps rather with the view of picking a quarrel than in the hope
of any valuable pacific result, that, about the close of A.D. 567,
Diza-bul, the Turkish Khan, sent ambassadors to Chosroes with proposals
for the establishment of free commercial intercourse between the Turks
and Persians, and even for the conclusion of a treaty of friendship and
alliance between the two nations. Chosroes suspected the motive for the
overture, but was afraid openly to reject it. He desired to discourage
intercourse between his own nation and the Turks, but could devise
no better mode of effecting his purpose than by burning the Turkish
merchandise offered to him after he had bought it, and by poisoning the
ambassadors and giving out that they had fallen victims to the climate.
His conduct exasperated the Turkish Khan, and created a deep and bitter
hostility between the Turks and Persians. It was at once resolved to
send an embassy to Constantinople and offer to the Greek emperor the
friendship which Chosroes had scorned. The embassy reached the Byzantine
court early in A.D. 568, and was graciously received by Justin, the
nephew of Justinian, who had succeeded his uncle on the imperial throne
between three and four years previously. A treaty of alliance was made
between the two nations; and a Roman embassy, empowered to ratify it,
visited the Turkish court in the Altai mountains during the course
of the next year (A.D. 569), and drew closer the bonds of friendship
between the high contracting powers. But meanwhile Dizabul, confident in
his own strength, had determined on an expedition into Persia. The Roman
ambassador, Zemarchus, accompanied him on a portion of his march, and
witnessed his insulting treatment of a Persian envoy, sent by
Chosroes to meet him and deprecate his attack. Beyond this point exact
information fails us; but we may suspect that this is the expedition
commemorated by Mirk-hond, wherein the Great Khan, having invaded the
Persian territory in force, made himself master of Shash, Ferghana,
Samarkand, Bokhara, Kesh, and Nesf, but, hearing that Hornisdas, son
of Chosroes, was advancing against him at the head of a numerous army,
suddenly fled, evacuating all the country that he had occupied, and
retiring to the most distant portion of Turkestan. At any rate the
expedition cannot have had any great success; for shortly afterwards
(A.D. 571) we find Turkish ambassadors once more visiting the Byzantine
court, and entreating Justin to renounce the fifty years' peace and
unite with them in a grand attack upon the common enemy, which, if
assaulted simultaneously on either side, might (they argued) be almost
certainly crushed. Justin gave the ambassadors no definite reply, but
renewed the alliance with Dizabul, and took seriously into consideration
the question whether he should not yield to the representations made
to him, and renew the war which Justinian had terminated nine years
previously.
</p>
<p>
There were many circumstances which urged him towards a rupture. The
payments to be made under the fifty years' peace had in his eyes the
appearance of a tribute rendered by Rome to Persia, which was, he
thought, an intolerable disgrace. A subsidy, not very dissimilar, which
Justinian had allowed the Saracenic Arabs under Persian rule, he had
already discontinued; and hostilities had, in consequence, already
commenced between the Persian and the Roman Saracens. The successes
of Chosroes in Western Arabia had at once provoked his jealousy,
and secured to Rome, in that quarter, an important ally in the great
Christian kingdom of Abyssinia. The Turks of Central Asia had sought his
friendship and offered to combine their attacks with his, if he would
consent to go to war. Moreover, there was once more discontent and
even rebellion in Armenia, where the proselytizing zeal of the Persian
governors had again driven the natives to take up arms and raise the
standard of independence. Above all, the Great King, who had warred with
such success for twenty years against his uncle, was now in advanced
age, and seemed to have given signs of feebleness, inasmuch as in his
recent expeditions he had individually taken no part, but had entrusted
the command of his troops to others. Under these circumstances, Justin,
in the year A.D. 572, determined to renounce the peace made ten
years earlier with the Persians, and to recommence the old struggle.
Accordingly he at once dismissed the Persian envoy, Sebocthes, with
contempt, refused wholly to make the stipulated payment, proclaimed his
intention of receiving the Armenian insurgents under his protection,
and bade Chosroes lay a finger on them at his peril. He then appointed
Marcian to the prefecture of the East, and gave him the conduct of the
war which was now inevitable.
</p>
<p>
No sooner did the Persian monarch find his kingdom seriously menaced
than, despite his advanced age, he immediately took the field in person.
Giving the command of a flying column of 6000 men to Adarman, a skilful
general, he marched himself against the Romans, who under Marcian had
defeated a Persian force, and were besieging Nisibis, forced them to
raise the siege, and, pressing forward as they retired, compelled them
to seek shelter within the walls of Daras, which he proceeded to
invest with his main army. Meanwhile Adarman, at the head of the troops
entrusted to him, crossed the Euphrates near Circesium, and, having
entered Syria, carried fire and sword far and wide over that fertile
province. Repulsed from Antioch, where, however, he burnt the suburbs
of the town, he invaded Coelesyria, took and destroyed Apamea, and then,
recrossing the great river, rejoined Chosroes before Daras. The renowned
fortress made a brave defence. For about five months it resisted,
without obtaining any relief, the entire force of Chosroes, who is said
to have besieged it with 40,000 horse and 100,000 foot. At last, on the
approach of winter, it could no longer hold out; enclosed within lines
of circumvallation, and deprived of water by the diversion of its
streams into new channels, it found itself reduced to extremity, and
forced to submit towards the close of A.D. 573. Thus the great Roman
fortress in these parts was lost in the first year of the renewed war;
and Justin, alarmed at his own temerity, and recognizing his weakness,
felt it necessary to retire from the conduct of affairs, and deliver
the reins of empire to stronger hands. He chose as his coadjutor and
successor the Count Tiberius, a Thracian by birth, who had long stood
high in his confidence; and this prince, in conjunction with the Empress
Sophia, now took the direction of the war.
</p>
<p>
The first need was to obtain a breathing-space. The Persian king having
given an opening for negotiations, advantage was taken of it by the
joint rulers to send an envoy, furnished with an autograph letter from
the empress, and well provided with the best persuasives of peace, who
was to suggest an armistice for a year, during which a satisfactory
arrangement of the whole quarrel might be agreed upon. Tiberius thought
that within this space he might collect an army sufficiently powerful
to re-establish the superiority of the Roman arms in the east; Chosroes
believed himself strong enough to defeat any force that Rome could now
bring into the field. A truce for a year was therefore concluded, at the
cost to Rome of 45,000 aurei; and immense efforts were at once made by
Tiberius to levy troops from his more distant, provinces, or hire them
from the lands beyond his borders. An army of 150,000 men was, it
is said, collected from the banks of the Danube and the Rhine, from
Scythia, Pannonia, Moesia, Illyricum, and Isauria; a general of repute,
Justinian, the son of Germanus, was selected to command them; and the
whole force was concentrated upon the eastern frontier but, after all
these preparations, the Caesar's heart failed him, and, instead of
offering battle to the enemy, Tiberius sent a second embassy to the
Persian head-quarters, early in A.D. 575, and besought an extension of
the truce. The Romans desired a short term of peace only, but wished for
a general suspension of hostilities between the nations; the Persians
advocated a longer interval, but insisted that the truce should not
extend to Armenia. The dispute continued till the armistice for a year
had run out; and the Persians had resumed hostilities and threatened
Constantina before the Romans would give way. At length it was agreed
that there should be peace for three years, but that Armenia should
be exempt from its operation. Rome was to pay to Persia, during the
continuance of the truce, the sum of 30,000 aurei annually.
</p>
<p>
No sooner was the peace concluded than Chosroes put himself at the
head of his army, and, entering Armenia Proper, proceeded to crush the
revolt, and to re-establish the Persian authority throughout the entire
region. No resistance was offered to him; and he was able, before the
close of the year, to carry his arms into the Roman territory of Armenia
Minor, and even to threaten Cappadocia. Here Justinian opposed his
progress; and in a partial engagement, Kurs (or Cursus), a leader of
Scythians in the Roman service, obtained an advantage over the Persian
rear-guard, captured the camp and the baggage, but did not succeed in
doing any serious damage. Chosroes soon afterwards revenged himself by
surprising and destroying a Roman camp during the night; he then took
and burnt the city of Melitene (Malatiyeh); after which, as winter was
approaching, he retired across the Euphrates, and returned into his own
country. Hereupon Justinian seems to have invaded Persian Armenia, and
to have enriched his troops with its plunder; according to some writers,
he even penetrated as far as the Caspian Sea, and embarked upon its
waters; he continued on Persian soil during the whole of the winter, and
it was not till the spring came that he re-entered Roman territory (A.D.
576).
</p>
<p>
The campaign of A.D. 576 is somewhat obscure. The Romans seem to have
gained certain advantages in Northern Armenia and Iberia, while Chosroes
on his part carried the war once more into Armenia Minor, and laid siege
to Theodosiopolis, which, however, he was unable to take. Negotiations
were upon this resumed, and had progressed favorably to a certain,
point, when news arrived of a great disaster to the Roman arms in
Armenia, which changed the face of affairs and caused the Persian
negotiators to break up the conference. Tam-chosro, a Persian general,
had completely defeated the Roman army under Justinian. Armenia had
returned to its allegiance. There seemed every reason to believe that
more was to be gained by arms than by diplomacy, and that, when the
three years peace had run out, the Great King might renew the general
war with a prospect of obtaining important successes.
</p>
<p>
There are no military events which can be referred to the year A.D.
577. The Romans and Persians amused each other with alternate embassies
during its course, and with negotiations that were not intended to have
any result. The two monarchs made vast preparations; and with the spring
of A.D. 578 hostilities recommenced. Chosroes is accused of having
anticipated the expiration of the truce by a period of forty days; but
it is more probable that he and the Romans estimated the date of
its expiration differently. However this was, it is certain that his
generals, Mebodes and Sapoes, took the field in early spring with 20,000
horse, and entering the Roman Armenia laid waste the country, at the
same time threatening Constantina and Theodosiopolis. Simultaneously
Tamchosro, quitting Persarmenia, marched westward and plundered the
country about Amida (Diarbekr). The Roman commander Maurice, who had
succeeded Justinian, possessed considerable military ability. On this
occasion, instead of following the ordinary plan of simply standing
on the defensive and endeavoring to repulse the invaders, he took the
bolder course of making a counter movement. Entering Persarmenia, which
he found denuded of troops, he carried all before him, destroying the
forts, and plundering the country. Though the summer heats brought
on him an attack of fever, he continued without pause his destructive
march; invaded and occupied Arzanene, with its stronghold, Aphumon,
carried off the population to the number of 10,090, and, pressing
forwards from Arzanene into Eastern Mesopotamia, took Singara, and
carried fire and sword over the entire region as far as the Tigris.
He even ventured to throw a body of skirmishers across the river into
Cordyene (Kurdistan); and these ravagers, who were commanded by Kurs,
the Scythian, spread devastation over a district where no Roman soldier
had set foot since its cession by Jovian. Agathias tells us that
Chosroes was at the time enjoying his summer villeggiatura in the
Kurdish hills, and saw from his residence the smoke of the hamlets which
the Roman troops had fired. He hastily fled from the danger, and shut
himself up within the walls of Ctesiphon, where he was soon afterwards
seized with the illness which brought his life to a close.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile Kurs, unconscious probably of the prize that had been so near
his grasp, recrossed the Tigris with his booty and rejoined Maurice, who
on the approach of winter withdrew into Roman territory, evacuating all
his conquests excepting Arzanene. The dull time of winter was, as usual,
spent in negotiations; and it was thought that a peace might have been
concluded had Chosroes lived. Tiberius was anxious to recover Daras,
and was willing to withdraw the Roman forces wholly from Persarmenia and
Iberia, and to surrender Arzanene and Aphumon, if Daras were restored to
him. He would probably have been content even to pay in addition a sum
of money. Chosroes might perhaps have accepted these terms; but while
the envoys empowered to propose them were on their way to his court,
early in the year A.D. 579, the aged monarch died in his palace at
Ctesiphon after a reign of forty-eight years.

</p>
<p>
A general consensus of the Oriental writers marks the reign of the first
Chosroes as a period not only of great military activity, but also
of improved domestic administration. Chosroes found the empire in a
disordered and ill-regulated condition, taxation arranged on a bad
system, the people oppressed by unjust and tyrannical governors,
the military service a prey to the most scandalous abuses, religious
fanaticism rampant, class at variance with class, extortion and wrong
winked at, crime unpunished, agriculture languishing, and the masses
throughout almost the whole of the country sullen and discontented.
It was his resolve from the first to carry out a series of reforms&mdash;to
secure the administration of even-handed justice, to put the finances on
a better footing, to encourage agriculture, to relieve the poor and the
distressed, to root out the abuses that destroyed the efficiency of the
army, and to excise the gangrene of fanaticism which was eating into
the heart of the nation. How he effected the last named object by
his wholesale destruction of the followers of Mazdak has been already
related; but it appeared unadvisable to interrupt, the military history
of the reign by combining with it any account of the numerous other
reforms which he accomplished. It remains therefore to consider them in
this place, since they are certainly not the least remarkable among the
many achievements of this great monarch.
</p>
<p>
Persia, until the time of Anushirwan, had been divided into a multitude
of provinces, the satraps or governors of which held their office
directly under the crown. It was difficult for the monarch to exercise
a sufficient superintendence over so large a number of rulers, many
of them remote from the court, and all united by a common interest.
Chosroes conceived the plan of forming four great governments, and
entrusting them to four persons in whom he had confidence, whose duty
it should be to watch the conduct of the provincial satraps to control
them, direct them, or report their misconduct to the crown. The four
great governments were those of the east, the north, the south, and
the west. The east comprised Khorassan, Seistan, and Kirman; the north,
Armenia, Azer-bijan, Ghilan, Koum, and Isfahan; the south, Fars and
Ahwaz; the west, Irak, or Babylonia, Assyria, and Mesopotamia.
</p>
<p>
It was not the intention of the monarch, however, to put a blind trust
in his instruments. He made personal progresses through his empire from,
time to time, visiting each province in turn and inquiring into the
condition of the inhabitants. He employed continually an army of
inspectors and spies, who reported to him from all quarters the
sufferings or complaints of the oppressed, and the neglects or misdoings
of those in authority. On the occurrence of any specially suspicious
circumstance, he appointed extraordinary commissions of inquiry,
which, armed with all the power of the crown, proceeded to the suspected
quarter, took evidence, and made a careful report of whatever wrongs or
malpractices they discovered.
</p>
<p>
When guilt was brought home to incriminated persons or parties, the
punishment with which they were visited was swift and signal. We have
seen how harsh were the sentences passed by Chosroes upon those whose
offences attacked his own person or dignity. An equal severity appears
in his judgments, where there was no question of his own wrongs, but
only of the interests of his subjects. On one occasion he is said to
have executed no fewer than eighty collectors of taxes on the report of
a commission charging them with extortion. Among the principal reforms
which Chosroes is said to have introduced was his fresh arrangement
of the taxation. Hitherto all lands had paid to the State a certain
proportion of their produce, a proportion which varied, according to the
estimated richness of the soil, from a tenth to one-half. The effect was
to discourage all improved cultivation, since it was quite possible that
the whole profit of any increased outlay might be absorbed by the State,
and also to cramp and check the liberty of the cultivators in various
ways, since the produce could not be touched until the revenue official
made his appearance and carried off the share of the crop which he had
a right to take. Chosroes resolved to substitute a land-tax for the
proportionate payments in kind, and thus at once to set the cultivator
at liberty with respect to harvesting his crops and to allow him the
entire advantage of any augumented production which might be secured by
better methods of farming his land. His tax consisted in part of a money
payment, in part of a payment in kind; but both payments were fixed and
invariable, each measure of ground being rated in the king's books at
one dirhem and one measure of the produce. Uncultivated land, and land
lying fallow at the time, were exempt; and thus the scheme involved,
not one survey alone, but a recurring (annual) survey, and an annual
registration of all cultivators, with the quantity of land under
cultivation held by each, and the nature of the crop or crops to be
grown by them. The system was one of much complication, and may have
pressed somewhat hardly upon the poorer and less productive soils; but
it was an immense improvement upon the previously existing practice,
which had all the disadvantages of the modern tithe system, aggravated
by the high rates exacted and by the certainty that, in any disputed
case, the subject would have had a poor chance of establishing his right
against the crown. It is not surprising that the caliphs, when they
conquered Persia, maintained unaltered the land system of Chosroes which
they found established, regarding it as, if not perfect, at any rate not
readily admitting of much improvement.
</p>
<p>
Besides the tax upon arable lands, of which we have hitherto spoken,
Chosroes introduced into into Persia various other imposts. The fruit
trees were everywhere counted, and a small payment required for each.
The personality of the citizens was valued, and a graduated property-tax
established, which, however, in the case of the most opulent, did not
exceed the moderate sum of forty-eight dirhems (about twenty-seven
shillings). A poll-tax was required of Jews and Christians, whereof we
do not know the amount. From all these burdens liberal exemptions were
made on account of age and sex; no female paid anything; and males above
fifty years of age or under twenty were also free of charge. Due notice
was given to each individual of the sum for which he was liable, by
the publication in each province, town, and village, of a tax table, in
which each citizen or alien could see against his name the amount about
to be claimed of him, with the ground upon which it was regarded as due.
Payment had to made by instalments, three times each year, at the end of
every four months.
</p>
<p>
In order to prevent the unfair extortion, which in the ancient world
was always, with reason or without, charged upon collectors of revenue,
Chosroes, by the advice of the Grand Mobed, authorized the Magian
priests everywhere to exercise a supervision over the receivers of
taxes, and to hinder them from exacting more than their due. The priests
were only too happy to discharge this popular function; and extortion
must have become rare under a system which comprised so efficient a
safeguard.
</p>
<p>
Another change ascribed to Chosroes is a reform of the administration of
the army. Under the system previously existing, Chosroes found that
the resources of the state were lavishly wasted, and the result was a
military force inefficient and badly accoutred. No security was taken
that the soldiers possessed their proper equipments or could discharge
the duties appropriate to their several grades. Persons came before the
paymaster, claiming the wages of a cavalry soldier, who possessed
no horse, and had never learned to ride. Some, who called themselves
soldiers, had no knowledge of the use of any weapon at all; others
claimed for higher grades of the service than those whereto they really
belonged; those who drew the pay of cuirassiers were destitute of a coat
of mail; those who professed themselves archers were utterly incompetent
to draw the bow. The established rates of pay varied between a hundred
dirhems a year and four thousand, and persons entitled to the lowest
rate often received an amount not much short of the highest. The evil
was not only that the treasury was robbed by unfair claims and unfounded
pretences, but that artifice and false seeming were encouraged, while
at the same time the army was brought into such a condition that no
dependence could be placed upon it. If the number who actually served
corresponded to that upon the rolls, which is uncertain, at any rate all
the superior arms of the service fell below their nominal strength, and
the lower grades were crowded with men who were only soldiers in name.
</p>
<p>
As a remedy against these evils, Chosroes appointed a single
paymaster-general, and insisted on his carefully inspecting and
reviewing each body of troops before he allowed it to draw its pay. Each
man was to appear before him fully equipped and to show his proficiency
with his weapon or weapons; horse soldiers were to bring their horses,
and to exhibit their mastery over the animals by putting them through
their paces, mounting and dismounting, and performing the other usual
exercises. If any clumsiness were noted, or any deficiency in the
equipment, the pay was to be withheld until the defect observed had been
made good. Special care was to be taken that no one drew the pay of a
class superior to that whereto he really belonged&mdash;of an archer, for
instance, when he was in truth a common soldier, or of a trooper when he
served not in the horse, but in the foot.
</p>
<p>
A curious anecdote is related in connection with these military reforms.
When Babek, the new paymaster, was about to hold his first review, he
issued an order that all persons belonging to the army then present in
the capital should appear before him on a certain day. The troops came;
but Babek dismissed them on the ground that a certain person whose
presence was indispensable had not made his appearance. Another day
was appointed, with the same result, except that Babek on this occasion
plainly intimated that it was the king whom he expected to attend. Upon
this Chosroes, when a third summons was issued, took care to be present,
and came fully equipped, as he thought, for battle. But the critical
eye of the reviewing officer detected an omission, which he refused
to overlook&mdash;the king had neglected to bring with him two extra
bow-strings. Chosroes was required to go back to his palace and remedy
the defect, after which he was allowed to pass muster, and then summoned
to receive his pay. Babek affected to consider seriously what the pay of
the commander-in-chief ought to be, and decided that it ought to exceed
that of any other person in the army. He then, in the sight of all,
presented the king with four thousand and one dirhems, which Chosroes
received and carried home. Thus two important principles were thought
to be established&mdash;that no defect of equipment whatsoever should be
overlooked in any officer, however high his rank, and that none should
draw from the treasury a larger amount of pay than 4,000 dirhems (L112.
of our money).
</p>
<p>
The encouragement of agriculture was an essential element in the system
of Zoroaster; and Chosroes, in devoting his attention to it, was at once
performing a religious duty and increasing the resources of the state.
It was his earnest desire to bring into cultivation all the soil which
was capable of it; and with this object he not only issued edicts
commanding the reclamation of waste lands, but advanced from the
treasury the price of the necessary seed-corn, implements, and beasts
to all poor persons willing to carry out his orders. Other poor persons,
especially the infirm and those disabled by bodily defect, were relieved
from his privy purse; mendicancy was forbidden, and idleness made an
offence. The lands forfeited by the followers of Mazdak were distributed
to necessitous cultivators. The water system was carefully attended to;
river and torrent courses were cleared of obstructions and straightened;
the superfluous water of the rainy season was stored, and meted out with
a wise economy to those who tilled the soil, in the spring and summer.
</p>
<p>
The prosperity of a country depends in part upon the laborious industry
of the inhabitants, in part upon their numbers. Chosroes regarded Persia
as insufficiently peopled, and made efforts to increase the population
by encouraging and indeed compelling marriage. All marriageable females
were required to provide themselves with husbands; if they neglected
this duty, the government interfered, and united them to unmarried men
of their own class. The pill was gilt to these latter by the advance of
a sufficient dowry from the public treasury, and by the prospect that,
if children resulted from the union, their education and establishment
in life would be undertaken by the state. Another method of increasing
the population, adopted by Chosroes to a certain extent, was the
settlement within his own territories of the captives whom he carried
off from foreign countries in the course of his military expeditions.
The most notorious instance of this policy was the Greek settlement,
known as Rumia (Rome), established by Chosroes after his capture of
Antioch (A.D. 540), in the near vicinity of Ctesiphon.
</p>
<p>
Oriental monarchs, in many respects civilized and enlightened, have
often shown a narrow and unworthy jealousy of foreigners. Chosroes had
a mind which soared above this petty prejudice. He encouraged the visits
of all foreigners, excepting only the barbarous Turks, readily received
them at his court, and carefully provided for their safety. Not only
were the roads and bridges kept in the most perfect order throughout his
territories, so as to facilitate locomotion, but on the frontiers and
along the chief lines of route guard-houses were built and garrisons
maintained for the express purpose of securing the safety of travellers.
The result was that the court of Chosroes was visited by numbers of
Europeans, who were hospitably treated, and invited, or even pressed, to
prolong their visits.
</p>
<p>
To the proofs of wisdom and enlightenment here enumerated Chosroes
added another, which is more surprising than any of them. He studied
philosophy, and was a patron of science and learning. Very early in his
reign he gave a refuge at his court to a body of seven Greek sages whom
a persecuting edict, issued by Justinian, had induced to quit their
country and take up their abode on Persian soil. Among the refugees was
the erudite Damascius, whose work De Principiis is well known, and has
recently been found to exhibit an intimate acquaintance with some of the
most obscure of the Oriental religions. Another of the exiles was the
eclectic philosopher Simplicius, "the most acute and judicious of the
interpreters of Aristotle." Chosroes gave the band of philosophers a
hospitable reception, entertained them at his table, and was unwilling
that they should leave his court. They found him acquainted with
the writings of Aristotle and Plato, whose works he had caused to be
translated into the Persian tongue. If he was not able to enter
very deeply into the dialectical and metaphysical subtleties which
characterize alike the Platonic Dialogues and the Aristotelian
treatises, at any rate he was ready to discuss with them such questions
as the origin of the world, its destructibility or indestructibility,
and the derivation of all things from one First Cause or from more.
Later in his reign, another Greek, a sophist named Uranius, acquired his
especial favor, became his instructor in the learning of his country,
and was presented by him with a large sum of money. Further, Chosroes
maintained at his court, for the space of a year, the Greek physician,
Tribunus, and offered him any reward that he pleased at his departure.
He also instituted at Gondi-Sapor, in the vicinity of Susa, a sort
of medical school, which became by degrees a university, wherein
philosophy, rhetoric, and poetry were also studied. Nor was it Greek
learning alone which attracted his notice and his patronage. Under his
fostering care the history and jurisprudence of his native Persia
were made special objects of study; the laws and maxims of the first
Artaxerxes, the founder of the monarchy, were called forth from the
obscurity which had rested on them for ages, were republished and
declared to be authoritative; while at the same time the annals of the
monarchy were collected and arranged, and a "Shah-nameh," or "Book of
the Kings," composed, which it is probable formed the basis of the great
work of Firdausi. Even the distant land of Hindustan was explored in
the search after varied knowledge, and contributed to the learning and
civilization of the time the fables of Bidpai and the game of chess.
</p>
<p>
Though a fierce persecutor of the deluded followers of Mazdak, Chosroes
admitted and practised, to some extent, the principles of toleration.
On becoming king, he laid it down as a rule of his government that
the actions of men alone, and not their thoughts, were subject to his
authority. He was therefore bound not to persecute opinion; and we may
suppose that in his proceedings against the Mazdakites he intended to
punish their crimes rather than their tenets. Towards the Christians,
who abounded in his empire, he certainly showed himself, upon the whole,
mild and moderate. He married a Christian wife, and allowed her to
retain her religion. When one of his sons became a Christian, the only
punishment which he inflicted on him was to confine him to the palace.
He augumented the number of the Christians in his dominions by the
colonies which he brought in from abroad. He allowed to his Christian
subjects the free exercise of their religion, permitted them to build
churches, elect bishops, and conduct services at their pleasure, and
even suffered them to bury their dead, though such pollution of the
earth was accounted sacrilegious by the Zoroastrians. No unworthy
compliances with the established cult were required of them.
Proselytism, however, was not allowed; and all Christian sects were
perhaps not viewed with equal favor. Chosroes, at any rate, is accused
of persecuting the Catholics and the Monophysites, and compelling
them to join the Nestorians, who formed the predominant sect in his
dominions. Conformity, however, in things outward, is compatible with a
wide diversity of opinion; and Chosroes, while he disliked differences
of practice, seems certainly to have encouraged, at least in his earlier
years, a freedom of discussion in religious matters which must have
tended to shake the hereditary faith of his subjects. He also gave on
one occasion a very remarkable indication of liberal and tolerant views.
When he made his first peace with Rome, the article on which he insisted
the most was one whereby the free profession of their known opinions and
tenets in their own country was secured to the seven Grecian sages
who had found at his court, in their hour of need, a refuge from
persecution.
</p>
<p>
In his domestic relations Chosroes was unfortunate. With his chief wife,
indeed, the daughter of the great Khan of the Turks, he seems to have
lived always on excellent terms; and it was his love for her which
induced him to select the son whom she had borne him for his successor
on the throne. But the wife who stood next in his favor displeased him
by her persistent refusal to renounce the religion of Christ and adopt
that of her husband in its stead; and the quarrel between them must have
been aggravated by the conduct of their child, Nushizad, who, when he
came to years of discretion, deliberately preferred the faith of
his mother to that of his father and of the nation. With this choice
Chosroes was naturally offended; but he restrained his anger within
moderate limits, and was content to punish the young prince by
forbidding him to quit the precincts of the palace. Unhappy results
followed. Nushizad in his confinement heard a rumor that his father, who
had started for the Syrian war, was struck with sickness, was not likely
to recover, was dead. It seemed to him a golden opportunity, of which
he would be foolish not to make the most. He accordingly quitted his
prison, spread the report of his father's death, seized the state
treasure, and scattered it with a liberal hand among the troops left in
the capital, summoned the Christians throughout the empire to his aid,
assumed the title and state of king, was acknowledged by the whole of
the southern province, and thought himself strong enough to take the
offensive and attempt the subjugation of Irak. Here, however, he was
met by Phabrizus (Firuz?), one of his father's generals, who completely
defeated his army in a pitched battle. According to one account,
Nushizad fell in the thick of the fight, mortally wounded by a chance
arrow. According to another, he was made prisoner, and carried to
Chosroes, who, instead of punishing him with death, destroyed his hopes
of reigning by inflicting on him a cruel disfigurement.
</p>
<p>
The coins of Chosroes are very numerous, and offer one or two novel and
curious types. The most remarkable have on the obverse the head of the
king, presenting the full face, and surmounted by a mural crown with a
low cap. The beard is close, and the hair arranged in masses on either
side. There are two stars above the crown, and two crescents, one over
either shoulder, with a star and crescent on the dress in front of each
shoulder. The kings wears a necklace, from which hang three pendants. On
the reverse these coins have a full-length figure of the king, standing
to the front, with his two hands resting on the hilt of his straight
sword, and its point placed between his feet. The crown worn resembles
that on the obverse; and there is a star and crescent on either side of
the head. The legend on the obverse is <i>Khusludi afzum</i>, "May Chosroes
increase;" the reverse has, on the left <i>Khusludi</i>, with the
regnal year; on the right, a longer legend which has not yet been
satisfactorily interpreted. <a href="#image-0003">[PLATE XXII., Fig. 3.]</a>
</p>
<p>
The more ordinary type on the coins of Chosroes I. is one differing but
little from those of his father, Kobad, and his son, Hormazd IV. The
obverse has the king's head in profile, and the reverse the usual
fire-altar and supporters. The distinguishing mark of these coins is,
in addition to the legend, that they have three simple crescents in the
margin of the obverse, instead of three crescents with stars. <a href="#image-0003">[PLATE
XXII., Fig. 4.]</a>
</p>
<p>
A relic of Chosroes has come down to us, which is of great beauty. This
is a cup composed of a number of small disks of colored glass, united
by a gold setting, and having at the bottom a crystal, engraved with a
figure of the monarch. As late as 1638 it was believed that the disks of
glass were jacynths, garnets, and emeralds, while the stone which forms
the base was thought to be a white sapphire. The original owner of so
rare a drinking-vessel could (it was supposed) only be Solomon; and the
figure at the bottom was accordingly supposed to represent the Jewish
king. Archaeologists are now agreed that the engraving on the gem, which
exactly resembles the figure upon the peculiar coins above described,
represents Chosroes Anushirwan, and is of his age. There is no
sufficient reason to doubt but that the cup itself is one out of which
he was accustomed to drink.
</p>
<p>
It is the great glory of Anushirwan that the title which his subjects
gave him was "the Just." According to European, and especially to modern
ideas, this praise would seem to have undeserved; and thus the great
historian of the Byzantine period has not scrupled to declare that in
his external policy Chosroes was actuated by mere ambition, and that "in
his domestic administration he deserved the appellation of a tyrant."
Undoubtedly the punishments which he inflicted were for the most part
severe; but they were not capricious, nor uniform, nor without reference
to the character of the offence. Plotting against his crown or
his person, when the conspirators were of full age, treasonable
correspondence with the enemy, violation of the sanctity of the harem,
and the proselytism which was strictly forbidden by the laws, he
punished with death. But, when the rebel was a mere youth, he was
content to inflict a disfigurement; whence the offence was less, he
could imprison, or confine to a particular spot, or simply banish
the culprit from his presence. Instances on record of his clemency to
offenders, and others which show that, when his own interests were at
stake, he steadily refused to make use of his unlimited power for
the oppression of individuals. It is unlikely that Anushirwan was
distinguished as "the Just" without a reason; and we may safely conclude
from his acknowledged title that his subjects found his rule more fair
and equitable than that of any previous monarch.
</p>
<p>
That the administration of Chosroes was wise, and that Persia prospered
under his government, is generally admitted. His vigilance, his
activity, his care for the poor, his efforts to prevent or check
oppression, are notorious, and cannot be gainsaid. Nor can it be doubted
that he was brave, hardy, temperate, prudent, and liberal. Whether
he possessed the softer virtues, compassion, kindliness, a tender and
loving heart, is perhaps open to question. He seems, however, to have
been a good husband and a good father, not easily offended, and not
over-severe whence offence was given him. His early severities against
his brothers and their followers may be regarded as caused by the advice
of others, and perhaps as justified by state policy. In his later life,
when he was his own master, he was content to chastise rebellion more
mildly.
</p>
<p>
Intellectually, there is no reason to believe that Chosroes rose very
high above the ordinary Oriental level. The Persians, and even many
Greeks, in his own day, exalted him above measure, as capable of
apprehending the most subtle arguments and the deepest problems of
philosophy; but the estimate of Agathias is probably more just, and this
reduces him to a standard about which there is nothing surprising. It
is to his credit that although engaged in almost perpetual wars, and
burdened moreover with the administration of a mighty empire, he had a
mind large enough to entertain the consideration also of intellectual
problems, and to enjoy and take part in their discussion; but it could
scarcely be expected that, with his numerous other employments, he
should really sound to their utmost depths the profundities of Greek
thought, or understand the speculative difficulties which separated
the various schools one from another. No doubt his knowledge was
superficial, and there may have been ostentation in the parade which
he made of it; but we must not deny him the praise of a quick, active
intellect, and a width of view rarely found in an Oriental.
</p>
<p>
It was not, however, in the field of speculative thought, but in that of
practical effort, that Chosroes chiefly distinguished himself and gained
his choicest laurels. The excellence of his domestic administration has
been already noticed. But, great as he was in peace, he was greater in
war. Engaged for nearly fifty years in almost uninterrupted contests,
he triumphed in every quarter, and scarcely experienced a reverse.
Victorious over the Romans, the Abyssinians, the Ephthalites, and the
Turks, he extended the limits of his empire on all sides, pacified
the discontented Armenia, crushed internal revolt, frustrated the most
threatening combinations, and established Persia in a position which
she had scarcely occupied since the days of Darius Hystaspis. Personally
engaged in above a score of fights, by the admission of his enemies he
was never defeated but once; and there are circumstances which make it
probable that this single check was of slight importance. The one real
failure that can be laid to his charge was in another quarter, and
involved no military, but only a political blunder. In recoiling from
the difficulties of the Lazic war, Chosroes had not to deplore
any disgrace to his arms, but simply to acknowledge that he had
misunderstood the temper of the Lazic people. In depreciation of his
military talents it may be said that he was never opposed to any great
general. With Belisarius it would certainly seem that he never actually
crossed swords; but Justinian and Maurice (afterwards emperor), to whom
he was opposed in his later years, were no contemptible antagonists. It
may further be remarked that the collapse of Persia in her struggle
with Rome as soon as Chosroes was in his grave is a tolerably decisive
indication that she owed her long career of victory under his guidance
to his possession of uncommon military ability.

</p>
<p>
At the death of Chosroes the crown was assumed without dispute or
difficulty by his son, Hormazd, who is known to the Greek and Latin
writers as Hormisdas IV. Hormazd was the eldest, or perhaps the only,
son borne to Chosroes by the Turkish princess, Fakim, who, from the time
of her marriage, had held the place of sultana, or principal wife. His
illustrious descent on both sides, added to the express appointment of
his father, caused him to be universally accepted as king; and we do
not hear that even his half-brothers, several of whom were older than
himself, put forward any claims in opposition to his, or caused him any
anxiety or trouble. He commenced his reign amid the universal plaudits
and acclamations of his subjects, whom he delighted by declaring that he
would follow in all things the steps of his father, whose wisdom so
much exceeded his own, would pursue his policy, maintain his officers in
power, and endeavor in all respects to govern as he had governed.
When the mobeds attempted to persuade him to confine his favor to
Zoroastrians and persecute such of his subjects as were Jews or
Christians he rejected their advice with the remark that, as in an
extensive territory there were sure to be varieties of soil, so it was
fitting that a great empire should embrace men of various opinions and
manners. In his progresses from one part of his empire to another he
allowed of no injury being done to the lands or gardens along the route,
and punished severely all who infringed his orders. According to some,
his good dispositions lasted only during the time that he enjoyed the
counsel and support of Abu-zurd-mihir, one of the best advisers of his
father; but when this venerated sage was compelled by the infirmities
of age to quit his court he fell under other influences, and soon
degenerated into the cruel tyrant which, according to all the
authorities, he showed himself in his later years.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, however, he was engaged in important wars, particularly
with the Roman emperors Tiberius and Maurice, who, now that the great
Chosroes was dead, pressed upon Persia with augmented force, in
the confident hope of recovering their lost laurels. On the first
intelligence of the great king's death, Tiberius had endeavored to
negotiate a peace with his successor, and had offered to relinquish all
claim on Armenia, and to exchange Arzanene with its strong fortress,
Aphumon, for Daras; but Hormisdas had absolutely rejected his proposals,
declared that he would surrender nothing, and declined to make peace on
any other terms than the resumption by Rome of her old system of paying
an annual subsidy. The war consequently continued; and Maurice, who
still held the command, proceeded, in the summer of A.D. 579, to take
the offensive and invade the Persian territory. He sent a force
across the Tigris under Romanus, Theodoric, and Martin, which ravaged
Kurdistan, and perhaps penetrated into Media, nowhere encountering any
large body of the enemy, but carrying all before them and destroying the
harvest at their pleasure. In the next year, A.D. 580, he formed a more
ambitious project. Having gained over, as he thought, Alamundarus, the
leader of the Saracens dependent on Persia, and collected a fleet to
carry his stores, he marched from Gircesium down the course of the
Euphrates, intending to carry the war into Southern Mesopotamia, and
perhaps hoping to capture Ctesiphon. He expected to take the Persians
unawares, and may not unnaturally have looked to gain an important
success; but, unhappily for his plans, Alamundarus proved treacherous.
The Persian king was informed of his enemy's march, and steps were at
once taken to render it abortive. Adarman was sent, at the head of a
large army, into Roman Mesopotamia, where he threatened the important
city of Callinicus in Maurice's rear. That general dared advance no
further. On the contrary, he felt constrained to fall back, to give
up his scheme, burn his fleet, and return hastily within the Roman
frontier. On his arrival, he engaged Adarman near the city which he was
attacking, defeated him, and drove him back into Persia.
</p>
<p>
In the ensuing spring, after another vain attempt at negotiation, the
offensive was taken by the Persians, who, early in A.D. 581, crossed the
frontier under Tam-chosro, and attacked the Roman city of Constantia,
or Constantina. Maurice hastened to its relief; and a great battle was
fought in the immediate vicinity of the city, wherein the Persians
were completely defeated, and their commander lost his life. Further
advantages might have been gained; but the prospect of the succession
drew Maurice to Constantinople, where Tiberius, stricken with a mortal
disease, received him with open arms, gave his daughter and the state
into his care, and, dying soon after, left him the legacy of the empire,
which he administered with success for above twenty years.
</p>
<p>
On quitting the East, Maurice devolved his command upon an officer who
bore the very common name of Johannes, but was distinguished further
by the epithet of Mustacon, on account of his abundant moustache.
This seems to have been a bad appointment. Mustacon was unequal to the
position. He gave the Persians battle at the conjunction of the Nymphius
with the Tigris, but was defeated with considerable loss, partly through
the misconduct of one of his captains. He then laid siege to Arbas, a
strong fort on the Persian side of the Nymphius, while the main body
of the Persians were attacking Aphumon in the neighboring district of
Arzanene. The garrison of Arbas made signals of distress, which speedily
brought the Persian army to their aid; a second battle was fought at
Arbas, and Mustacon was again defeated, and forced to retire across
the Nymphius into Roman territory. His incapacity was now rendered so
clearly evident that Maurice recalled him, and gave the command of the
army of the East to a new general, Philippicus, his brother-in-law.
</p>
<p>
The first and second campaigns of Philippicus, in the years A.D. 584
and 585, were of the most commonplace character. He avoided any general
engagement, and contended himself with plundering inroads into the
Persian territory on either side of the Upper Tigris, occasionally
suffering considerably from want of water and provisions. The Persians
on their part undertook no operations of importance until late in A.D.
585, when Philippicus had fallen sick. They then made attempts upon
Monocartum and Martyropolis, which were unsuccessful, resulting only in
the burning of a church and a monastery near the latter town. Neither
side seemed capable of making any serious impression upon the other; and
early the next year negotiations were resumed, which, however, resulted
in nothing.
</p>
<p>
In his third campaign Philippicus adopted a bolder line of proceeding.
Commencing by an invasion of Eastern Mesopotamia, he met and defeated
the Persians in a great battle near Solachon, having first roused the
enthusiasm of his troops by carrying along their ranks a miraculous
picture of our Lord, which no human hand had painted. Hanging on the
rear of the fugitives, he pursued them to Daras, which declined to
receive within its walls an army that had so disgraced itself. The
Persian commander withdrew his troops further inland; and Philippicus,
believing that he had now no enemy to fear, proceeded to invade
Arzanene, to besiege the stronghold of Chlomaron, and at the same time
to throw forward troops into the more eastern parts of the country. He
expected them to be unopposed; but the Persian general, having rallied
his force and augmented it by fresh recruits, had returned towards
the frontier, and, hearing of the danger of Arzanene, had flown to its
defence. Philippicus was taken by surprise, compelled to raise the siege
of Chlomaron, and to fall back in disorder. The Persians pressed on his
retreat, crossed the Nymphius after him, and did not desist from the
pursuit until the imperial general threw himself with his shattered
army into the strong fortress of Amida. Disgusted and discredited by his
ill-success, Philippicus gave over the active prosecution of the war
to Heraclius, and, remaining at head-quarters, contented himself with a
general supervision.
</p>
<p>
Heraclius, on receiving his appointment, is said to have at once assumed
the offensive, and to have led an army, consisting chiefly or entirely
of infantry, into Persian territory, which devastated the country on
both sides of the Tigris, and rejoined Philippicus, without having
suffered any disaster, before the winter. Philippicus was encouraged
by the success of his lieutenant to continue him in command for another
year; but, through prudence or jealousy, he was induced to intrust a
portion only of the troops to his care, while he assigned to others the
supreme authority over no less than one third of the Roman army. The
result was, as might have been expected, inglorious for Rome. During
A.D. 587 the two divisions acted separately in different quarters; and,
at the end of the year, neither could boast of any greater success than
the reduction, in each case, of a single fortress. Philippicus, however,
seems to have been satisfied; and at the approach of winter he withdrew
from the East altogether, leaving Heraclius as his representative, and
returned to Constantinople.
</p>
<p>
During the earlier portion of the year A.D. 588 the mutinous temper
of the Roman army rendered it impossible that any military operations
should be undertaken. Encouraged by the disorganization of their
enemies, the Persians crossed the frontier, and threatened Constantina,
which was however saved by Germanus. Later in the year, the mutinous
spirit having been quelled, a counter-expedition was made by the Romans
into Arzanene. Here the Persian general, Maruzas, met them, and drove
them from the province; but, following up his success too ardently, he
received a complete defeat near Martyropolis, and lost his life in the
battle. His head was cut off by the civilized conquerors, and sent as a
trophy to Maurice.
</p>
<p>
The campaign of A.D. 589 was opened by a brilliant stroke on the part
of the Persians, who, through the treachery of a certain Sittas, a petty
officer in the Roman army, made themselves masters of Martyropolis. It
was in vain that Philippicus twice besieged the place; he was unable to
make any impression upon it, and after a time desisted from the attempt.
On the second occasion the garrison was strongly reinforced by the
Persians under Mebodos and Aphraates, who, after defeating Philippicus
in a pitched battle, threw a large body of troops into the town.
Philippicus was upon this deprived of his office, and replaced by
Comentiolus, with Heraclius as second in command. The new leaders,
instead of engaging in the tedious work of a siege, determined on
re-establishing the Roman prestige by a bold counter-attack. They
invaded the Persian territory in force, ravaged the country about
Nisibis, and brought Aphraates to a pitched battle at Sisarbanon,
near that city. Victory seemed at first to incline to the Persians;
Comentiolus was defeated and fled; but Horaclius restored the battle,
and ended by defeating the whole Persian army, and driving it from the
field, with the loss of its commander, who was slain in the thick of the
fight. The next day the Persian camp was taken, and a rich booty fell
into the hands of the conquerors, besides a number of standards. The
remnant of the defeated army found a refuge within the walls of Nisibis.
Later in the year Comentiolus recovered to some extent his tarnished
laurels by the siege and capture of Arbas, whose strong situation in the
immediate vicinity of Martyropolis rendered the position of the Persian
garrison in that city insecure, if not absolutely untenable.
</p>
<p>
Such was the condition of affairs in the western provinces of the
Persian Empire, when a sudden danger arose in the east, which had
strange and most important consequences. According to the Oriental
writers, Hormisdas had from a just monarch gradually become a tyrant;
under the plea of protecting the poor had grievously oppressed the
rich; through jealousy or fear had put to death no fewer than thirteen
thousand of the upper classes, and had thus completely alienated all
the more powerful part of the nation. Aware of his unpopularity, the
surrounding tribes and peoples commenced a series of aggressions,
plundered the frontier provinces, defeated the detachments sent against
them under commanders who were disaffected, and everywhere brought the
empire into the greatest danger. The Arabs crossed the Euphrates and
spread themselves over Mesopotamia; the Khazars invaded Armenia and
Azerbijan; rumor said that the Greek emperor had taken the field and was
advancing on the side of Syria, at the head of 80,000 men; above all, it
was quite certain that the Great Khan of the Turks had put his hordes
in motion, had passed the Oxus with a countless host, occupied Balkh and
Herat, and was threatening to penetrate into the very heart of Persia.
The perilous character of the crisis is perhaps exaggerated; but there
can be little doubt that the advance of the Turks constituted a real
danger. Hormisdas, however, did not even now quit the capital, or
adventure his own person. He selected from among his generals a certain
Varahran or Bahram, a leader of great courage and experience, who had
distinguished himself in the wars of Anushirwan, and, placing all the
resources of the empire at his disposal, assigned to him the entire
conduct of the Turkish struggle. Bahram is said to have contented
himself with a small force of picked men, veterans between forty and
fifty years of age, to have marched with them upon Balkh, contended
with the Great Khan in several partial engagements, and at last entirely
defeated him in a great battle, wherein the Khan lost his life. This
victory was soon followed by another over the Khan's son, who was made
prisoner and sent to Hormisdas. An enormous booty was at the same time
despatched to the court; and Bahram himself was about to return, when he
received his master's orders to carry his arms into another quarter.
</p>
<p>
It is supposed, by some that, while the Turkish hordes were menacing
Persia upon the north-east, a Roman army, intended to act in concert
with them, was sent by Maurice into Albania, which proceeded to threaten
the common enemy in the north-west. But the Byzantine writers know of no
alliance at this time between the Romans and Turks; nor do they tell
of any offensive movement undertaken by Rome in aid of the Turkish
invasion, or even simultaneously with it. According to them, the war
in this quarter, which certainly broke out in A.D. 589, was provoked by
Hormisdas himself, who, immediately after his Turkish victories, sent
Bahram with an army to invade Colchis and Suania, or in other words to
resume the Lazic war, from which Anushirwan had desisted twenty-seven
years previously. Bahram found the province unguarded, and was able to
ravage it at his will; but a Roman force soon gathered to its defence,
and after some manoeuvres a pitched battle was fought on the Araxes, in
which the Persian general suffered a defeat. The military results of
the check were insignificant; but it led to an internal revolution.
Hormisdas had grown jealous of his too successful lieutenant, and was
glad of an opportunity to insult him. No sooner did he hear of Bahram's
defeat than he sent off a messenger to the camp upon the Araxes, who
deprived the general of his command, and presented to him, on the part
of his master, a distaff, some cotton, and a complete set of women's
garments. Stung to madness by the undeserved insult, Bahram retorted
with a letter, wherein he addressed Hormisdas, not as the son, but as
the daughter of Chosroes. Shortly afterwards, upon the arrival of a
second messenger from the court, with orders to bring the recalcitrant
commander home in chains, Bahram openly revolted, caused the envoy to
be trampled upon by an elephant, and either by simply putting before the
soldiers his services and his wrongs, or by misrepresenting to them the
intentions of Hormisdas towards themselves, induced his whole army with
one accord to embrace his cause.
</p>
<p>
The news of the great general's revolt was received with acclamations
by the provinces. The army of Mesopotamia, collected at Nisibis, made
common cause with that of Albania; and the united force, advancing on
the capital by way of Assyria, took up a position upon the Upper Zab
river. Hormisdas sent a general, Pherochanes, to meet and engage the
rebels; but the emissaries of Bahram seduced his troops from their
allegiance; Pherochanes was murdered; and the insurgent army, augmented
by the force sent to oppose it, drew daily nearer to Ctesiphon.
Meanwhile Hormisdas, distracted between hate and fear, suspecting every
one, trusting no one, confined himself within the walls of the capital,
where he continued to exercise the severities which had lost him the
affections of his subjects. According to some, he suspected his son,
Chosroes, of collusion with the enemy, and drove him into banishment,
imprisoning at the same time his own brothers in-law, Bindoes and
Bostam, who would be likely, he thought, to give their support to their
nephew. These violent measures precipitated the evils which he feared;
a general revolt broke out in the palace; Bostam and Bindoes, released
from prison, put themselves at the head of the malcontents, and, rushing
into the presence-chamber, dragged the tyrant from his throne, stripped
him of the diadem, and committed him to the dungeon from which they had
themselves escaped. The Byzantine historians believed that, after this,
Hormisdas was permitted to plead his cause before an assembly of Persian
nobles, to glorify his own reign, vituperate his eldest son, Chosroes,
and express his willingness to abdicate in favor of another son, who
had never offended him. They supposed that this ill-judged oration had
sealed the fate of the youth recommended and of his mother, who were cut
to pieces before the fallen monarch's eyes, while at the same time the
rage of the assembly was vented in part upon Hormisdas himself, who was
blinded, to make his restoration impossible. But a judicious critic will
doubt the likelihood of rebels, committed as were Bindoes and Bostam,
consenting to allow such an appeal as is described by Theophylact; and
a perusal of the speeches assigned to the occasion will certainly not
diminish his scepticism. The probability would seem to be that Hormisdas
was blinded as soon as committed to prison, and that shortly afterwards
he suffered the general fate of deposed sovereigns, being assassinated
in his place of confinement.
</p>
<p>
The deposition of Hormisdas was followed almost immediately by the
proclamation of his eldest son, Chosroes, the prince known in history
as "Eberwiz" or "Parviz," the last great Persian monarch. The rebels at
Ctesiphon had perhaps acted from first to last with his cognizance: at
any rate, they calculated on his pardoning proceedings which had given
him actual possession of a throne whereto, without their aid, he might
never have succeeded. They accordingly declared him king of Persia
without binding him by conditions, and without negotiating with Bahram,
who was still in arms and at no great distance.
</p>
<p>
Before passing to the consideration of the eventful reign with which we
shall now have to occupy ourselves, a glance at the personal character
of the deceased monarch will perhaps be expected by the reader. Hormuzd
is pronounced by the concurrent voice of the Greeks and the Orientals
one of the worst princes that ever ruled over Persia. The fair promise
of his early years was quickly clouded over; and during the greater
portion of his reign he was a jealous and capricious tyrant, influenced
by unworthy favorites, and stimulated to ever-increasing severities by
his fears. Eminence of whatsoever kind roused his suspicions; and among
his victims were included, besides the noble and the great, a large
number of philosophers and men of science. His treatment of Bahram was
at once a folly and a crime&mdash;an act of black ingratitude, and a rash
step, whereof he had not counted the consequences. To his other vices
he added those of indolence and effeminacy. From the time that he became
king nothing could drag him from the soft life of the palace; in no
single instance did he take the field, either against his country's
enemies or his own. Miserable as was his end, we can scarcely deem him
worthy of our pity, since there never lived a man whose misfortunes were
more truly brought on him by his own conduct.
</p>
<p>
The coins of Hormisdas IV. are in no respect remarkable. The head seems
modelled on that of Chosroes, his father, but is younger. The field of
the coin within the border is somewhat unduly crowded with stars and
crescents. Stars and crescents also occur outside the border, replacing
the simple crescents of Chosroes, and reproducing the combined stars and
crescents of Zamasp. The legend on the obverse is <i>Auhramazdi afzud</i>,
or sometimes <i>Auhramazi afzun</i>; on the reverse are commonly found,
besides the usual fire-altar and supporters, a regnal year and a
mint-mark. The regnal years range from one to thirteen; the number of
the mint-marks is about thirty. <a href="#image-0004">[PLATE XXIII., Fig. 1.]</a>

</p>
<p>
The position of Chosroes II. on his accession was one of great
difficulty. Whether actually guilty of parricide or not, he was at any
rate suspected by the greater part of his subjects of complicity in his
father's murder. A rebel, who was the greatest Persian general of
the time, at the head of a veteran army, stood arrayed against his
authority. He had no established character to fall back upon, no merits
to plead, nothing in fact to urge on his behalf but that he was the
eldest son of his father, the legitimate representative of the ancient
line of the Sassanidae. A revolution had placed him on the throne in a
hasty and irregular manner; nor is it clear that he had ventured on the
usual formality of asking the consent of the general assembly of the
nobles to his coronation. Thus perils surrounded him on every side; but
the most pressing danger of all, that which required to be immediately
met and confronted, was the threatening attitude of Bahram, who had
advanced from Adiabene to Holwan, and occupied a strong position not
a hundred and fifty miles from the capital. Unless Bahram could be
conciliated or defeated, the young king could not hope to maintain
himself in power, or feel that he had any firm grasp of the sceptre.
</p>
<p>
Under these circumstances he took the resolution to try first the method
of conciliation. There seemed to be a fair opening for such a course. It
was not he, but his father, who had given the offence which drove
Bahram into rebellion, and almost forced him to vindicate his manhood by
challenging his detractor to a trial of strength. Bahram could have
no personal ground of quarrel with him. Indeed that general had at the
first, if we may believe the Oriental writers, proclaimed Chosroes as
king, and given out that he took up arms in order to place him upon
the throne. It was thought, moreover, that the rebel might feel himself
sufficiently avenged by the death of his enemy, and might be favorably
disposed towards those who had first blinded Hormisdas and then
despatched him by the bowstring. Chosroes therefore composed a letter in
which he invited Bahram to his court, and offered him the second place
in the kingdom, if he would come in and make his submission. The message
was accompanied by rich presents, and by an offer that if the terms
proposed wera accepted they should be confirmed by oath.
</p>
<p>
The reply of Bahram was as follows: "Bahram, friend of the gods,
conqueror, illustrious, enemy of tyrants, satrap of satraps, general of
the Persian host, wise, apt for command, god-fearing, without reproach,
noble, fortunate, successful, venerable, thrifty, provident, gentle,
humane, to Chosroes the son of Hormisdas (sends greeting). I have
received the letter which you wrote with such little wisdom, but have
rejected the presents which you sent with such excessive boldness. It
had been better that you should have abstained from sending either, more
especially considering the irregularity of your appointment, and the
fact that the noble and respectable took no part in the vote, which
was carried by the disorderly and low-born. If then it is your wish to
escape your father's fate, strip off the diadem which you have assumed
and deposit it in some holy place, quit the palace, and restore to their
prisons the criminals whom you have set at liberty, and whom you had no
right to release until they had undergone trial for their crimes. When
you have done all this, come hither, and I will give you the government
of a province. Be well advised, and so farewell. Else, be sure you will
perish like your father." So insolent a missive might well have provoked
the young prince to some hasty act or some unworthy show of temper. It
is to the credit of Chosroes that he restrained himself, and even made
another attempt to terminate the quarrel by a reconciliation. While
striving to outdo Bahram in the grandeur of his titles, he still
addressed him as his friend. He complimented him on his courage,
and felicitated him on his excellent health. "There were certain
expressions," he said, "in the letter that he had received, which he
was sure did not speak his friend's real feelings. The amanuensis had
evidently drunk more wine than he ought, and, being half asleep when he
wrote, had put down things that were foolish and indeed monstrous. But
he was not disturbed by them. He must decline, however, to send back
to their prisons those whom he had released, since favors granted by
royalty could not with propriety be withdrawn; and he must protest that
in the ceremony of his coronation all due formalities had been observed.
As for stripping himself of his diadem, he was so far from contemplating
it that he looked forward rather to extending his dominion over new
worlds. As Bahram had invited him, he would certainly pay him a visit;
but he would be obliged to come as a king, and if his persuasions did
not produce submission he would have to compel it by force of arms. He
hoped that Bahram would be wise in time, and would consent to be his
friend and helper."
</p>
<p>
This second overture produced no reply; and it became tolerably evident
that the quarrel could only be decided by the arbitrament of battle.
Chosroes accordingly put himself at the head of such troops as he could
collect, and marched against his antagonist, whom he found encamped
on the Holwan River. The place was favorable for an engagement; but
Chosroes had no confidence in his soldiers. He sought a personal
interview with Bahram, and renewed his offers of pardon and favor; but
the conference only led to mutual recriminations, and at its close
both sides appealed to arms. During six days the two armies merely
skirmished, since Chosroes bent all his efforts towards avoiding a
general engagement; but on the seventh day Bahram surprised him by an
attack after night had fallen,a threw his troops into confusion, and
then, by a skilful appeal to their feelings, induced them to desert
their leader and come over to his side. Chosroes was forced to fly. He
fell back on Ctesiphon; but despairing of making a successful defence,
with the few troops that remained faithful to him, against the
overwhelming force which Bahram had at his disposal, he resolved to
evacuate the capital, to quit Persia, and to throw himself on the
generosity of some one of his neighbors. It is said that his choice
was long undetermined between the Turks, the Arabs, the Khazars of
the Caucasian region, and the Romans. According to some writers, after
leaving Ctesiphon, with his wives and children, his two uncles, and an
escort of thirty men, he laid his reins on his horse's neck, and left it
to the instinct of the animal to determine in what direction he should
flee. The sagacious beast took the way to the Euphrates; and Chosroes,
finding himself on its banks, crossed the river, and, following up its
course, reached with much difficulty the well-known Roman station of
Circesium. He was not unmolested in his retreat. Bahram no sooner heard
of his flight than he sent off a body of 4000 horse, with orders to
pursue and capture the fugitive. They would have succeeded, had not
Bindoes devoted himself on behalf of his nephew, and, by tricking the
officer in command, enabled Chosroes to place such a distance between
himself and his pursuers that the chase had to be given up, and the
detachment to return, with no more valuable capture than Bindoes, to
Ctesiphon.
</p>
<p>
Chosroes was received with all honor by Probus, the governor of
Circesium, who the next day communicated intelligence of what had
happened to Comentiolus, Prefect of the East, then resident at
Hierapolis. At the same time he sent to Comentiolus a letter which
Chosroes had addressed to Maurice, imploring his aid against his
enemies. Comentiolus approved what had been done, despatched a courier
to bear the royal missive to Constantinople, and shortly afterwards, by
the direction of the court, invited the illustrious refugee to remove
to Hierapolis, and there take up his abode, till his cause should be
determined by the emperor. Meanwhile, at Constantinople, after the
letter of Chosroes had been read, a serious debate arose as to what was
fittest to be done. While some urged with much show of reason that
it was for the interest of the empire that the civil war should be
prolonged, that Persia should be allowed to waste her strength and
exhaust her resources in the contest, at the end of which it would be
easy to conquer her, there were others whose views were less selfish
or more far-sighted. The prospect of uniting the East and West into a
single monarchy, which had been brought to the test of experiment by
Alexander and had failed, did not present itself in a very tempting
light to these minds. They doubted the ability of the declining empire
to sway at once the sceptre of Europe and of Asia. They feared that if
the appeal of Chosroes were rejected, the East would simply fall into
anarchy, and the way would perhaps be prepared for some new power
to rise up, more formidable than the kingdom of the Sassanidae.
The inclination of Maurice, who liked to think himself magnanimous,
coincided with the views of these persons: their counsels were accepted;
and the reply was made to Chosroes that the Roman emperor accepted him
as his guest and son, undertook his quarrel, and would aid him with all
the forces of the empire to recover his throne. At the same time Maurice
sent him some magnificent presents, and releasing the Persian prisoners
in confinement at Constantinople, bade them accompany the envoys of
Chosroes and resume the service of their master. Soon afterwards more
substantial tokens of the Imperial friendship made their appearance. An
army of 70,000 men arrived under Narses; and a subsidy was advanced by
the Imperial treasury, amounting (according to one writer) to about two
millions sterling.
</p>
<p>
But this valuable support to his cause was no free gift of a generous
friend; on the contrary, it had to be purchased by great sacrifices.
Chosroes had perhaps at first hoped that aid would be given him
gratuitously, and had even regarded the cession of a single city as one
that he might avoid making. But he learnt by degrees that nothing was
to be got from Rome without paying for it; and it was only by
ceding Persarmenia and Eastern Mesopotamia, with its strong towns of
Martyropolis and Daras, that he obtained the men and money that were
requisite.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile Bahram, having occupied Ctesiphon, had proclaimed himself
king, and sent out messengers on all sides to acquaint the provinces
with the change of rulers. The news was received without enthusiasm, but
with a general acquiescence; and, had Maurice rejected the application
of Chosroes, it is probable that the usurper might have enjoyed a long
and quiet reign. As soon, however, as it came to be known that the Greek
emperor had espoused, the cause of his rival, Bahram found himself
in difficulties: conspiracy arose in his own court, and had to be
suppressed by executions; murmurs were heard in some of the more distant
provinces; Armenia openly revolted and declared for Chosroes; and it
soon appeared that in places the fidelity of the Persian troops was
doubtful. This was especially the case in Mesopotamia, which would
have to bear the brunt of the attack when the Romans advanced. Bahram
therefore thought it necessary, though it was now the depth of winter,
to strengthen his hold on the wavering province, and sent out two
detachments, under commanders upon whom he could rely, to occupy
respectively Anatho and Nisibis, the two strongholds of greatest
importance in the suspected region. Miraduris succeeded in entering and
occupying Anatho. Zadesprates was less fortunate; before he reached the
neighborhood of Nisibis, the garrison which held that place had deserted
the cause of the usurper and given in its adhesion to Chosroes; and,
when he approached to reconnoitre, he was made the victim of a stratagem
and killed by an officer named Rosas. Miraduris did not long survive
him; the troops which he had introduced into Anatho caught the contagion
of revolt, rose up against him, slew him, and sent his head to Chosroes.
</p>
<p>
The spring was now approaching, and the time for military operations
on a grand scale drew near. Chosroes, besides his supporters in
Mesopotamia, Roman and Persian, had a second army in Azerbijan, raised
by his uncles Bindoes and Bostam, which was strengthened by an Armenian
contingent. The plan of campaign involved the co-operation of these two
forces. With this object Chosroes proceeded early in the spring, from
Hierapolis to Constantina, from Constantina to Daras, and thence by way
of Ammodion to the Tigris, across which he sent a detachment, probably
in the neighborhood of Mosul. This force fell in with Bryzacius, who
commanded in these parts for Bahram, and surprising him in the first
watch of the night, defeated his army and took Bryzacius himself
prisoner. The sequel, which Theophylact appears to relate from the
information of an eye-witness, furnishes a remarkable evidence of the
barbarity of the times. Those who captured Bryzacius cut off his nose
and his ears, and in this condition sent him to Chosroes. The Persian
prince was overjoyed at the success, which no doubt he accepted as a
good omen; he at once led his whole army across the river, and having
encamped for the night at a place called Dinabadon, entertained the
chief Persian and Roman nobles at a banquet. When the festivity was at
its height, the unfortunate prisoner was brought in loaded with fetters,
and was made sport of by the guests for a time, after which, at a
signal from the king, the guards plunged their swords into his body, and
despatched him in the sight of the feasters. Having amused his guests
with this delectable interlude, the amiable monarch concluded the whole
by anointing them with perfumed ointment, crowning them with flowers,
and bidding them drink to the success of the war. "The guests," says
Theophylact, "returned, to their tents, delighted with the completeness
of their entertainment, and told their friends how handsomely they
had been treated, but the crown of all (they said) was the episode of
Bryzacius."
</p>
<p>
Chosroes next day advanced across the Greater Zab, and, after marching
four days, reached Alexandrian a position probably not far from Arbela,
after which, in two days more, he arrived at Chnaethas, which was a
district upon the Zab Asfal, or Lesser Zab River. Here he found himself
in the immediate vicinity of Bahram, who had taken up his position on
the Lesser Zab, with the intention probably of blocking the route up its
valley, by which he expected that the Armenian army would endeavor to
effect a junction with the army of Chosroes. Here the two forces watched
each other for some days, and various manoeuvres were executed, which it
is impossible to follow, since Theophylact, our only authority, is not
a good military historian. The result, however, is certain. Bahram was
out-manoeuvred by Chosroes and his Roman allies; the fords of the Zab
were seized; and after five days of marching and counter-marching,
the longed-for junction took place. Chosroes had the satisfaction
of embracing his uncles Bindoes and Bostam, and of securing such a
reinforcement as gave him a great superiority in numbers over his
antagonist.
</p>
<p>
About the same time he received intelligence of another most important
success. Before quitting Daras, he had despatched Mebodes, at the head
of a small body of Romans, to create a diversion on the Mesopotomian
side of the Tigris by a demonstration from Singara against Seleucia
and Ctesiphon. He can hardly have expected to do more than distract
his enemy and perhaps make him divide his forces. Bahram, however, was
either indifferent as to the fate of the capital, or determined not to
weaken the small army, which was all that he could muster, and on which
his whole dependence was placed. He left Seleucia and Ctesiphon to their
fate. Mebodes and his small force marched southward without meeting
an enemy, obtained possession of Seleucia without a blow after the
withdrawal of the garrison, received the unconditional surrender of
Ctesiphon, made themselves masters of the royal palace and treasures,
proclaimed Chosroes king, and sent to him in his camp the most precious
emblems of the Persian sovereignty. Thus, before engaging with his
antagonist, Chosroes recovered his capital and found his authority once
more recognized in the seat of government.
</p>
<p>
The great contest had, however, to be decided, not by the loss and gain
of cities, nor by the fickle mood of a populace, but by trial of arms in
the open field. Bahram was not of a temper to surrender his sovereignty
unless compelled by defeat. He was one of the greatest generals of the
age, and, though compelled to fight under every disadvantage, greatly
outnumbered by the enemy, and with troops that were to a large extent
disaffected, he was bent on resisting to the utmost, and doing his best
to maintain his own rights. He seems to have fought two pitched battles
with the combined Romans and Persians, and not to have succumbed until
treachery and desertion disheartened him and ruined his cause. The first
battle was in the plain country of Adiabene, at the foot of the Zagros
range. Here the opposing armies were drawn out in the open field, each
divided into a centre and two wings. In the army of Chosroes the Romans
were in the middle, on the right the Persians, and the Armenians on the
left. Narses, together with Chosroes, held the central position: Bahram
was directly opposed to them. When the conflict began the Romans charged
with such fierceness that Bahram's centre at once gave way; he was
obliged to retreat to the foot of the hills, and take up a position on
their slope. Here the Romans refused to attack him; and Chosroes very
imprudently ordered the Persians who fought on his side to advance up
the ascent. They were repulsed, and thrown into complete confusion; and
the battle would infallibly have been lost, had not Narses come to their
aid, and with his steady and solid battalions protected their retreat
and restored the fight. Yet the day terminated with a feeling on both
sides that Bahram had on the whole had the advantage in the engagement;
the king <i>de facto</i> congratulated himself; the king <i>de jure</i> had to
bear the insulting pity of his allies, and the reproaches of his own
countrymen for occasioning them such a disaster.
</p>
<p>
But though Bahram might feel that the glory of the day was his, he was
not elated by his success, nor rendered blind to the difficulties of his
position. Fighting with his back to the mountains, he was liable, if he
suffered defeat, to be entangled in their defiles and lose his entire
force. Moreover, now that Ctesiphon was no longer his, he had neither
resources nor <i>point d'appui</i> in the low country, and by falling back
he would at once be approaching nearer to the main source of his own
supplies, which was the country about Rei, south of the Caspian, and
drawing his enemies to a greater distance from the sources of theirs.
He may even have thought there was a chance of his being unpursued if
he retired, since the Romans might not like to venture into the mountain
region, and Chosroes might be impatient to make a triumphal entry into
his capital. Accordingly, the use which Bahram made of his victory was
quietly to evacuate his camp, to leave the low plain region, rapidly
pass the mountains, and take up his quarters in the fertile upland
beyond them, the district where the Lesser Zab rises, south of Lake
Urumiyeh.
</p>
<p>
If he had hoped that his enemies would not pursue him, Bahram was
disappointed. Chosroes himself, and the whole of the mixed army which
supported his cause, soon followed on his footsteps, and pressing
forward to Canzaca, or Shiz, near which he had pitched his camp, offered
him battle for the second time. Bahram declined the offer, and retreated
to a position on the Balarathus, where, however, after a short time, he
was forced to come to an engagement. He had received, it would seem, a
reinforcement of elephants from the provinces bordering on India, and
hoped for some advantage from the employment of this new arm. He had
perhaps augmented his forces, though it must be doubted whether he
really on this occasion outnumbered his antagonist. At any rate, the
time seemed to have come when he must abide the issue of his appeal to
arms, and secure or lose his crown by a supreme effort. Once more the
armies were drawn up in three distinct bodies; and once more the leaders
held the established central position. The engagement began along the
whole line, and continued for a while without marked result. Bahram then
strengthened his left, and, transferring himself to this part of the
field, made an impression on the Roman right. But Narses brought up
supports to their aid, and checked the retreat, which had already begun,
and which might soon have become general. Hereupon Bahram suddenly fell
upon the Roman centre and endeavored to break it and drive it from the
field; but Narses was again a match for him, and met his assault without
flinching, after which, charging in his turn, he threw the Persian
centre into confusion. Seeing this, the wings also broke, and a general
flight began, whereupon 6000 of Bahram's troops deserted, and, drawing
aside, allowed themselves to be captured. The retreat then became a
rout. Bahram himself fled with 4,000 men. His camp, with all its rich
furniture, and his wives and children, were taken. The elephant corps
still held out and fought valiantly; but it was surrounded and forced
to surrender. The battle was utterly lost; and the unfortunate chief,
feeling that all hope was gone, gave the reins to his horse and fled for
his life. Chosroes sent ten thousand men in pursuit, under Bostam, his
uncle; and this detachment overtook the fugitives, but was repulsed
and returned. Bahram continued his flight, and passing through Rei and
Damaghan, reached the Oxus and placed himself under the protection
of the Turks. Chosroes, having dismissed his Roman allies, re-entered
Ctesiphon after a year's absence, and for the second time took his place
upon the throne of his ancestors.
</p>
<p>
The coins of Bahram possess a peculiar interest. While there is no
numismatic evidence which confirms the statement that he struck money
in the name of the younger Chosroes, there are extant three types of
his coins, two of which appear to belong to the time before he seated
himself upon the throne, while one&mdash;the last&mdash;belongs to the period of
his actual sovereignty. In his preregnal coins, he copied the devices of
the last sovereign of his name who had ruled over Persia. He adopted
the mural crown in a decided form, omitted the stars and crescents, and
placed his own head amid the flames of the fire-altar. His legends were
either <i>Varahran Chub</i>, "Bahram of the mace," or <i>Varahran,
maljcan malka, mazdisn, bagi, ramashtri</i>, "Bahram, king of kings,
Ormazd-worshipping, divine, peaceful." <a href="#image-0004">[PLATE XXIII, Fig. 2.]</a>
</p>
<p>
The later coins follow closely the type of his predecessor, Hormisdas
IV., differing only in the legend, which is, on the obverse, <i>Varahran
afzun</i>, or "Varahran (may he be) greater;" and on the reverse the
regnal year, with a mint-mark. The regnal year is uniformly "one;" the
mint-marks are Zadracarta, Iran, and Nihach, an unknown locality. <a href="#image-0004">[PLATE

</p>
<p>
The second reign of Chosroes II., who is commonly known as Chosroes
Eberwiz or Parwiz, lasted little short of thirty-seven years&mdash;from the
summer of A.D. 591 to the February of A.D. 628. Externally considered,
it is the most remarkable reign in the entire Sassanian series,
embracing as it does the extremes of elevation and depression. Never at
any other time did the Neo-Persian kingdom extend itself so far, or
so distinguish itself by military achievements, as in the twenty years
intervening between A.D. 602 and A.D. 622. Seldom was it brought so low
as in the years immediately anterior and immediately subsequent to
this space, in the earlier and in the later portions of the reign whose
central period was so glorious.
</p>
<p>
Victorious by the help of Rome, Chosroes began his second reign amid the
scarcely disguised hostility of his subjects. So greatly did he mistrust
their sentiments towards him that he begged and obtained of Maurice the
support of a Roman bodyguard, to whom he committed the custody of his
person. To the odium always attaching in the minds of a spirited people
to the ruler whose yoke is imposed upon them by a foreign power, he
added further the stain of a crime which is happily rare at all times,
and of which (according to the general belief of his subjects) no
Persian monarch had ever previously been guilty. It was in vain that he
protested his innocence: the popular belief held him an accomplice in
his father's murder, and branded the young prince with the horrible name
of "parricide."
</p>
<p>
It was no doubt mainly in the hope of purging himself from this
imputation that, after putting to death the subordinate instruments by
whom his father's life had been actually taken, he went on to institute
proceedings against the chief contrivers of the outrage&mdash;the two uncles
who had ordered, and probably witnessed, the execution. So long as the
success of his arms was doubtful, he had been happy to avail himself of
their support, and to employ their talents in the struggle against
his enemies. At one moment in his flight he had owed his life to the
self-devotion of Bindoes; and both the brothers had merited well of him
by the efforts which they had made to bring Armenia over to his cause,
and to levy a powerful army for him in that region. But to clear his own
character it was necessary that he should forget the ties both of blood
and gratitude, that he should sink the kinsman in the sovereign, and the
debtor in the stern avenger of blood. Accordingly, he seized Bindoes,
who resided at the court, and had him drowned in the Tigris. To Bostam,
whom he had appointed governor of Rei and Khorassan, he sent an order
of recall, and would undoubtedly have executed him, had he obeyed;
but Bostam, suspecting his intentions, deemed it the wisest course to
revolt, and proclaim himself independent monarch of the north country.
Here he established himself in authority for some time, and is even
said to have enlarged his territory at the expense of some of the border
chieftains; but the vengeance of his nephew pursued him unrelentingly,
and ere long accomplished his destruction. According to the best
authority, the instrument employed was Bostam's wife, the sister of
Bahram, whom Chosroes induced to murder her husband by a promise to make
her the partner of his bed.
</p>
<p>
Intrigues not very dissimilar in their character had been previously
employed to remove Bahram, whom the Persian monarch had not ceased to
fear, notwithstanding that he was a fugitive and an exile. The Khan of
the Turks had received him with honor on the occasion of his flight,
and, according to some authors, had given him his daughter in marriage.
Chosroes lived in dread of the day when the great general might reappear
in Persia, at the head of the Turkish hordes, and challenge him to renew
the lately-terminated contest.
</p>
<p>
He therefore sent an envoy into Turkestan, well supplied with rich
gifts, whose instructions were to procure by some means or other the
death of Bahram. Having sounded the Khan upon the business and met with
a rebuff, the envoy addressed himself to the Khatun, the Khan's wife,
and by liberal presents induced her to come into his views. A slave
was easily found who undertook to carry out his mistress's wishes, and
Bahram was despatched the same day by means of a poisoned dagger. It is
painful to find that one thus ungrateful to his friends and relentless
to his enemies made, to a certain extent, profession of Christianity.
Little as his heart can have been penetrated by its spirit, Chosroes
seems certainly, in the earlier part of his reign, to have given
occasion for the suspicion, which his subjects are said to have
entertained, that he designed to change his religion, and confess
himself a convert to the creed of the Greeks. During the period of his
exile, he was, it would seem, impressed by what he saw and heard, of
the Christian worship and faith; he learnt to feel or profess a high
veneration for the Virgin; and he adopted the practice, common at the
time, of addressing his prayers and vows to the saints and martyrs,
who were practically the principal objects of the Oriental Christians'
devotions. Sergius, a martyr, hold in high repute by the Christians of
Osrhoene and Mesopotamia, was adopted by the superstitious prince as
a sort of patron saint; and it became his habit, in circumstances of
difficulty, to vow some gift or other to the shrine of St. Sergius
at Sergiopolis, in case of the event corresponding to his wishes. Two
occasions are recorded where, on sending his gift, he accompanied
it with a letter explaining the circumstances of his vow and its
fulfilment; and even the letters themselves have come down to us, but in
a Greek version. In one, Chosroes ascribes the success of his arms on a
particular occasion to the influence of his self-chosen patron; in the
other, he credits him with having procured by his prayers the pregnancy
of Sira (Shirin), the most beautiful and best beloved of his wives. It
appears that Sira was a Christian, and that in marrying her Chosroes had
contravened the laws of his country, which forbade the king to have a
Christian wife. Her influence over him was considerable, and she is said
to have been allowed to build numerous churches and monasteries in and
about Ctesiphon. When she died, Chosroes called in the aid of sculpture
to perpetuate her image, and sent her statue to the Roman Emperor, to
the Turkish Khan, and to various other potentates.
</p>
<p>
Chosroes is said to have maintained an enormous seraglio; but of these
secondary wives, none is known to us even by name, except Kurdiyeh, the
sister of Bahram and widow of Bostam, whom she murdered at Chosroes's
suggestion.
</p>
<p>
During the earlier portion of his reign Chosroes seems to have been
engaged in but few wars, and those of no great importance. According to
the Armenian writers, he formed a design of depopulating that part of
Armenia which he had not ceded to the Romans, by making a general levy
of all the males, and marching them off to the East, to fight against
the Ephthalites; but the design did not prosper, since the Armenians
carried all before them, and under their native leader, Smbat, the
Bagratunian, conquered Hyrcania and Tabaristan, defeated repeatedly the
Koushans and the Ephthalites, and even engaged with success the Great
Khan of the Turks, who came to the support of his vassals at the head
of an army consisting of 300.000 men. By the valor and conduct of Smbat,
the Persian dominion was re-established in the north-eastern mountain
region, from Mount Demavend to the Hindu Kush; the Koushans, Turks, and
Ephthalitos were held in check; and the tide of barbarism, which had
threatened to submerge the empire on this side, was effectually resisted
and rolled back.
</p>
<p>
With Rome Chosroes maintained for eleven years the most friendly
and cordial relations. Whatever humiliation he may have felt when he
accepted the terms on which alone Maurice was willing to render him aid,
having once agreed to them, he stifled all regrets, made no attempt to
evade his obligations, abstained from every endeavor to undo by intrigue
what he had done, unwillingly indeed, but yet with his eyes open. Once
only during the eleven years did a momentary cloud arise between him
and his benefactor. In the year A.D. 600 some of the Saracenic tribes
dependent on Rome made an incursion across the Euphrates into Persian
territory, ravaged it far and wide, and returned with their booty
into the desert. Chosroes was justly offended, and might fairly have
considered that a <i>casus belli</i> had arisen; but he allowed himself to
be pacified by the representations of Maurice's envoy, George, and
consented not to break the peace on account of so small a matter. George
claimed the concession as a tribute to his own amiable qualities; but
it is probable that the Persian monarch acted rather on the grounds of
general policy than from any personal predilection.
</p>
<p>
Two years later the virtuous but perhaps over-rigid Maurice was deposed
and murdered by the centurion, Phocas, who, on the strength of his
popularity with the army, boldly usurped the throne. Chosroes heard
with indignation of the execution of his ally and friend, of the insults
offered to his remains, and of the assassination of his numerous sons,
and of his brother. One son, he heard, had been sent off by Maurice to
implore aid from the Persians; he had been overtaken and put to death
by the emissaries of the usurper; but rumor, always busy where royal
personages are concerned, asserted that he lived, that he had escaped
his pursuers, and had reached Ctesiphon. Chosroes was too much
interested in the acceptance of the rumor to deny it; he gave out that
Theodosius was at his court, and notified that it was his intention
to assert his right to the succession. When, five months after his
coronation, Phocas sent an envoy to announce his occupation of the
throne, and selected the actual murderer of Maurice to fill the post,
Chosroes determined on an open rupture. He seized Lilius, the envoy,
threw him into prison, announced his intention of avenging his deceased
benefactor, and openly declared war against Rome.
</p>
<p>
The war burst out the next year (A.D. 603). On the Roman side there was
disagreement, and even civil war; for Narses, who had held high command
in the East ever since he restored Chosroes to the throne of his
ancestors, on hearing of the death of Maurice, took up arms against
Phocas, and, throwing himself into Edessa, defied the forces of the
usurper. Germanus, who commanded at Daras, was a general of small
capacity, and found himself quite unable to make head, either against
Narses in Edessa, or against Chosroes, who led his troops in person into
Mesopotamia. Defeated by Chosroes in a battle near Daras, in which he
received a mortal wound, Germanus withdrew to Constantia, where he died
eleven days afterwards. A certain Leontius, a eunuch, took his place,
but was equally unsuccessful. Chosroes defeated him at Arxamus, and
took a great portion of his army prisoners; whereupon he was recalled by
Phocas, and a third leader, Domentziolus, a nephew of the emperor, was
appointed to the command. Against him the Persian monarch thought it
enough to employ generals. The war now languished for a short space; but
in A.D. 605 Chosroes came up in person against Daras, the great Roman
stronghold in these parts, and besieged it for the space of nine months,
at the end of which time it surrendered. The loss was a severe blow to
the Roman prestige, and was followed in the next year by a long
series of calamities. Chosroes took Tur-abdin, Hesen-Cephas, Mardin,
Capher-tuta, and Amida. Two years afterwards, A.D. 607, he captured
Harran (Carrhse), Ras-el-ain (Resaina), and Edessa, the capital of
Osrhoene, after which he pressed forward to the Euphrates, crossed with
his army into Syria, and fell with fury on the Roman cities west of the
river. Mabog or Hierapolis, Kenneserin, and Berhoea (now Aleppo), were
invested and taken in the course of one or at most two campaigns; while
at the same time (A.D. 609) a second Persian army, under a general
whose name is unknown, after operating in Armenia, and taking Satala
and Theodosiopolis, invaded Cappadocia and threatened the great city of
Caesarea Mazaca, which was the chief Roman stronghold in these parts.
Bands of marauders wasted the open country, carrying terror through the
fertile districts of Phyrgia and Galatia, which had known nothing of
the horrors of war for centuries, and were rich with the accumulated
products of industry. According to Theophanes, some of the ravages even
penetrated as far as Chalcedon, on the opposite side of the straits
from Constantinople; but this is probably the anticipation of an event
belonging to a later time. No movements of importance are assigned to
A.D. 610; but in the May of the next year the Persians once more crossed
the Euphrates, completely defeated and destroyed the Roman army which
protected Syria, and sacked the two great cities of Apameia and Antioch.
</p>
<p>
Meantime a change had occurred at Constantinople. The double revolt of
Heraclius, prefect of Egypt, and Gregory, his lieutenant, had brought
the reign of the brutal and incapable Phocas to an end, and placed
upon the imperial throne a youth of promise, innocent of the blood
of Maurice, and well inclined to avenge it. Chosroes had to consider
whether he should adhere to his original statement, that he took up arms
to punish the murderer of his friend, and benefactor, and consequently
desist from further hostilities now that Phocas was dead, or whether,
throwing consistency to the winds, he should continue to prosecute the
war, notwithstanding the change of rulers, and endeavor to push to the
utmost the advantage which he had already obtained. He resolved on this
latter alternative. It was while the young Heraclius was still insecure
in his seat that he sent his armies into Syria, defeated the Roman
troops, and took Antioch and Apameia. Following up blow with blow, he
the next year (A.D. 612) invaded Cappadocia a second time and captured
Csesarea Mazaca. Two years later (A.D. 614) he sent his general
Shahr-Barz, into the region east of the Antilibanus, and took the
ancient and famous city of Damascus. From Damascus, in the ensuing year,
Shahr-Barz advanced against Palestine, and, summoning the Jews to his
aid, proclaimed a Holy War against the Christian misbelievers, whom
he threatened to enslave or exterminate. Twenty-six thousand of these
fanatics flocked to his standard; and having occupied the Jordan region
and Galileee, Shahr-Barz in A.D. 615 invested Jerusalem, and after a
siege of eighteen days forced his way into the town, and gave it over to
plunder and rapine. The cruel hostility of the Jews had free vent.
The churches of Helena, of Constantine, of the Holy Sepulchre, of the
Resurrection, and many others, were burnt or ruined; the greater part of
the city was destroyed; the sacred treasuries were plundered; the relics
scattered or carried off; and a massacre of the inhabitants, in which
the Jews took the chief part, raged throughout the whole city for some
days. As many as seventeen thousand or, according to another account,
ninety thousand, were slain. Thirty-five thousand were made prisoners.
Among them was the aged Patriarch, Zacharius, who was carried captive
into Persia, where he remained till his death.
</p>
<p>
The Cross found by Helena, and believed to be "the True Cross," was at
the same time transported to Ctesiphon, where it was preserved with care
and duly venerated by the Christian wife of Chosroes.
</p>
<p>
A still more important success followed. In A.D. 616 Shahr-Barz
proceeded from Palestine into Egypt, which had enjoyed a respite from
foreign war since the time of Julius Caesar, surprised Pelusium, the
key of the country, and, pressing forward across the Delta, easily made
himself master of the rich and prosperous Alexandria. John the Merciful,
who was the Patriarch, and Nicetas the Patrician, who was the governor,
had quitted the city before his arrival, and had fled to Cyprus. Hence
scarcely any resistance was made. The fall of Alexandria was followed at
once by the complete submission of the rest of Egypt. Bands of Persians
advanced up the Nile valley to the very confines of Ethiopia, and
established the authority of Chosroes over the whole country&mdash;a country
in which no Persian had set foot since it was wrested by Alexander of
Macedon from Darius Codomannus.
</p>
<p>
While this remarkable conquest was made in the southwest, in the
north-west another Persian army under another general, Saina or Shahen,
starting from Cappadocia, marched through Asia Minor to the shores of
the Thracian Bosphorus, and laid siege to the strong city of Chalcedon,
which lay upon the strait, just opposite Constantinople. Chalcedon
made a vigorous resistance; and Heraclius, anxious to save it, had an
interview with Shahen, and at his suggestion sent three of his highest
nobles as ambassadors to Chosroes, with a humble request for peace.
The overture was ineffectual. Chosroes imprisoned the ambassadors and
entreated them cruelly; threatened Shahen with death for not bringing
Heraclius in chains to the foot of his throne; and declared in reply
that he would grant no terms of peace&mdash;the empire was his, and Heraclius
must descend from his throne. Soon afterwards (A.D. 617) Chalcedon,
which was besieged through the winter, fell; and the Persians
established themselves in this important stronghold, within a mile
of Constantinople. Three years afterwards, Ancyra (Angora), which
had hitherto resisted the Persian arms, was taken; and Rhodes, though
inaccessible to an enemy who was without a naval force, submitted.
</p>
<p>
Thus the whole of the Roman possessions in Asia and Eastern Africa were
lost in the space of fifteen years. The empire of Persia was extended
from the Tigris and Euphrates to the Egean and the Nile, attaining once
more almost the same dimensions that it had reached under the first and
had kept until the third Darius. It is difficult to say how far their
newly acquired provinces wore really subdued, organized, and governed
from Ctesiphon, how far they were merely overrun, plundered, and
then left to themselves. On the one hand, we have indications of the
existence of terrible disorders and of something approaching to anarchy
in parts of the conquered territory during the time that it was held by
the Persians; on the other, we seem to see an intention to retain,
to govern, and even to beautify it. Eutychius relates that, on the
withdrawal of the Romans from Syria, the Jews resident in Tyre, who
numbered four thousand, plotted with their co-religionists of Jerusalem,
Cyprus, Damascus, and Galilee, a general massacre of the Tyrian
Christians on a certain day. The plot was discovered; and the Jews of
Tyre were arrested and imprisoned by their fellow-citizens, who put the
city in a state of defence; and when the foreign Jews, to the number of
26,000, came at the appointed time, repulsed them from the walls, and
defeated them with great slaughter. This story suggests the idea of a
complete and general disorganization. But on the other hand we hear of
an augmentation of the revenue under Chosroes II., which seems to imply
the establishment in the regions conquered of a settled government; and
the palace at Mashita, discovered by a recent traveller, is a striking
proof that no temporary occupation was contemplated, but that Chosroes
regarded his conquests as permanent acquisitions, and meant to hold them
and even visit them occasionally.
</p>
<p>
Heraclius was now well-nigh driven to despair. The loss of Egypt reduced
Constantinople to want, and its noisy populace clamored for food. The
Avars overran Thrace, and continually approached nearer to the capital.
The glitter of the Persian arms was to be seen at any moment, if he
looked from his palace windows across the Bosphorus. No prospect of
assistance or relief appeared from any quarter. The empire was reduced
to the walls of Constantinople, with the remnant of Greece, Italy, and
Africa, and some maritime cities, from Tyre to Trebizond, of the Asiatic
Coast. It is not surprising that under the circumstances the despondent
monarch determined on flight, and secretly made arrangements for
transporting himself and his treasures to the distant Carthage, where
he might hope at least to find himself in safety. His ships, laden with
their precious freight, had put to sea, and he was about to follow them,
when his intention became known or was suspected; the people rose; and
the Patriarch, espousing their side, forced the reluctant prince to
accompany him to the church of St. Sophia, and there make oath that,
come what might, he would not separate his fortunes from those of the
imperial city.
</p>
<p>
Baffled in his design to escape from his difficulties by flight,
Heraclius took a desperate resolution. He would leave Constantinople to
its fate, trust its safety to the protection afforded by its walls and
by the strait which separated it from Asia, embark with such troops as
he could collect, and carry the war into the enemy's country. The one
advantage which he had over his adversary was his possession of an ample
navy, and consequent command of the sea and power to strike his blows
unexpectedly in different quarters. On making known his intention,
it was not opposed, either by the people or by the Patriarch. He was
allowed to coin the treasures of the various churches into money, to
collect stores, enroll troops, and, on the Easter Monday of A.D. 622, to
set forth on his expedition.
</p>
<p>
His fleet was steered southward, and, though forced to contend
with adverse gales, made a speedy and successful voyage through the
Propontis, the Hellespont, the Egean, and the Cilician Strait, to the
Gulf of Issus, in the angle between Asia Minor and Syria. The position
was well chosen, as one where attack was difficult, where numbers would
give little advantage, and where consequently a small but resolute force
might easily maintain itself against a greatly superior enemy. At the
same time it was a post from which an advance might conveniently be
made in several directions, and which menaced almost equally Asia Minor,
Syria, and Armenia. Moreover, the level tract between the mountains and
the sea was broad enough for the manoeuvres of such an army as Heraclius
commanded, and allowed him to train his soldiers by exercises and sham
fights to a familiarity with the sights and sounds and movements of a
battle. He conjectured, rightly enough, that he would not long be left
unmolested by the enemy. Shahr-Barz, the conqueror of Jerusalem and
Egypt, was very soon sent against him; and, after various movements,
which it is impossible to follow, a battle was fought between the two
armies in the mountain country towards the Armenian frontier, in which
the hero of a hundred fights was defeated and the Romans, for the first
time since the death of Maurice, obtained a victory. After this, on the
approach of winter, Heraclius, accompanied probably by a portion of his
army, returned by sea to Constantinople.
</p>
<p>
The next year the attack was made in a different quarter. Having
concluded alliances with the Khan of the Khazars and some other chiefs
of inferior power, Heraclius in the month of March embarked with 5000
men, and proceeded from Constantinople by way of the Black Sea first
to Trebizond, and then to Mingrelia or Lazica. There he obtained
contingents from his allies, which, added to the forces collected from.
Trebizond and the other maritime towns, may perhaps have raised his
troops to the number of 120,000, at which we find them estimated. With
this army, he crossed the Araxes, and invaded Armenia. Chosroes, on
receiving the intelligence, proceeded into Azorbijan with 40,000 men,
and occupied the strong city of Canzaca, the site of which is probably
marked by the ruins known as Takht-i-Suleiman. At the same time he
ordered two other armies, which he had sent on in advance, one of them
commanded by Shahr-Barz, the other by Shahen, to effect a junction
and oppose themselves to the further progress of the emperor. The two
generals were, however, tardy in their movements, or at any rate were
outstripped by the activity of Heraclius, who, pressing forward from
Armenia into Azerbijan, directed his march upon Canzaca, hoping to bring
the Great King to a battle. His advance-guard of Saracens did actually
surprise the picquets of Chosroes; but the king himself hastily
evacuated the Median stronghold, and retreated southwards through
Ardelan towards the Zagros mountains, thus avoiding the engagement which
was desired by his antagonist. The army, on witnessing the flight of
their monarch, broke up and dispersed. Heraclius pressed upon the flying
host and slew all whom he caught, but did not suffer himself to be
diverted from his main object, which was to overtake Chosroes. His
pursuit, however, was unsuccessful. Chosroes availed himself of the
rough and difficult country which lies between Azerbijan and the
Mesopotamian lowland, and by moving from, place to place contrive to
baffle his enemy. Winter arrived, and Heraclius had to determine whether
he would continue his quest at the risk of having to pass the cold
season in the enemy's country, far from all his resources, or relinquish
it and retreat to a safe position. Finding his soldiers divided in their
wishes, he trusted the decision to chance, and opening the Gospel at
random settled the doubt by applying the first passage that met his eye
to its solution. The passage suggested retreat; and Heraclius, retracing
his steps, recrossed the Araxes, and wintered in Albania.
</p>
<p>
The return of Heraclius was not unmolested. He had excited the
fanaticism of the Persians by destroying, wherever he went, the temples
of the Magians, and extinguishing the sacred fire, which it was a part
of their religion to keep continually burning. He had also everywhere
delivered the cities and villages to the flames, and carried off many
thousands of the population. The exasperated enemy consequently hung
upon his rear, impeded his march, and no doubt caused him considerable
loss, though, when it came to fighting, Heraclius always gained the
victory. He reached Albania without sustaining any serious disaster,
and even brought with him 50,000 captives; but motives of pity, or of
self-interest, caused him soon afterwards to set these prisoners free.
It would have been difficult to feed and house them through the long and
severe winter, and disgraceful to sell or massacre them.
</p>
<p>
In the year A.D. 624 Chosroes took the offensive, and, before Heraclius
had quitted his winter quarters, sent a general, at the head of a force
of picked troops, into Albania, with the view of detaining him in that
remote province during the season of military operations. But Sarablagas
feared his adversary too much to be able very effectually to check his
movements; he was content to guard the passes, and hold the high ground,
without hazarding an engagement. Heraclius contrived after a time
to avoid him, and penetrated into Persia through a series of plains,
probably those along the course and about the mouth of the Araxes. It
was now his wish to push rapidly southward; but the auxiliaries on whom
he greatly depended were unwilling; and, while he doubted what course
to take, three Persian armies, under commanders of note, closed in upon
him, and threatened his small force with destruction. Heraclius feigned
a disordered flight, and drew on him an attack from two out of the three
chiefs, which he easily repelled. Then he fell upon the third, Shahen,
and completely defeated him. A way seemed to be thus opened for him into
the heart of Persia, and he once more set off to seek Chosroes; but now
his allies began to desert his standard, and return to their homes;
the defeated Persians rallied and impeded his march; he was obliged to
content himself with a third, victory, at a place which Theophanes
calls Salban, where he surprised Shahr-Barz in the dead of the night,
massacred his troops, his wives, his officers, and the mass of the
population, which fought from the flat roofs of the houses, took the
general's arms and equipage, and was within a little of capturing
Shahr-barz himself. The remnant of the Persian army fled in disorder,
and was hunted down by Heraclius, who pursued the fugitives unceasingly
till the cold season approached, and he had to retire into cantonments.
The half-burnt Salban afforded a welcome shelter to his troops during
the snows and storms of an Armenian winter.
</p>
<p>
Early in the ensuing spring the indefatigable emperor again set his
troops in motion, and, passing the lofty range which separates the basin
of Lake Van from the streams that flow into the upper Tigris, struck
that river, or rather its large affluent, the Bitlis Chai, in seven days
from Salban, crossed into Arzanene, and proceeding westward recovered
Martyropolis and Amida, which had now been in the possession of the
Persians for twenty years. At Amida he made a halt, and wrote to
inform the Senate of Constantinople of his position and his victories,
intelligence which they must have received gladly after having lost
sight of him for above a twelvemonth. But he was not allowed to remain
long undisturbed. Before the end of March Shahr-Barz had again taken
the field in force, had occupied the usual passage of the Euphrates, and
threatened the line of retreat which Heraclius had looked upon as open
to him. Unable to cross the Euphrates by the bridge, which Shahr-barz
had broken, the emperor descended the stream till he found a ford,
when he transported his army to the other bank, and hastened by way of
Samosata and Germanicaea into Cilicia. Here he was once more in his own
territory, with the sea close at hand, ready to bring him supplies or
afford him a safe retreat, in a position with whose advantages he was
familiar, where broad plains gave an opportunity for skilful maneuvers,
and deep rapid rivers rendered defence easy. Heraclius took up a
position on the right bank of the Sarus (Syhuri), in the immediate
vicinity of the fortified bridge by which alone the stream could be
crossed. Shahr-Barz followed, and ranged his troops along the left bank,
placing the archers in the front line, while he made preparations to
draw the enemy from the defence of the bridge into the plain on the
other side. He was so far successful that the Roman occupation of the
bridge was endangered; but Heraclius, by his personal valor and by
almost superhuman exertions, restored the day; with his own hand he
struck down a Persian of gigantic stature and flung him from the bridge
into the river; then pushing on with a few companions, he charged the
Persian host in the plain, receiving undaunted a shower of blows, while
he dealt destruction on all sides. The fight was prolonged until the
evening and even then was undecided; but Shahr-Barz had convinced
himself that he could not renew the combat with any prospect of victory.
He therefore retreated during the night, and withdrew from Cilicia.
Heraclius, finding himself free to march where he pleased, crossed
the Taurus, and proceeded to Sebaste (Sivas), upon the Halys, where
he wintered in the heart of Cappadocia, about half-way between the two
seas. According to Theophanes the Persian monarch was so much enraged at
this bold and adventurous march, and at the success which had attended
it, that, by way of revenging himself on Heraclius, he seized the
treasures of all the Christian churches in his dominions, and
compelled the orthodox believers to embrace the Nestorian heresy. The
twenty-fourth year of the war had now arrived, and it was difficult
to say on which side lay the balance of advantage. If Chosroes still
maintained his hold on Syria, Egypt, and Asia Minor as far as
Chalcedon, if his troops still flaunted their banners within sight
of Constantinople, yet on the other hand he had seen his hereditary
dominions deeply penetrated by the armies of his adversary; he had had
his best generals defeated, his cities and palaces burnt, his favorite
provinces wasted; Heraclius had proved himself a most formidable
opponent; and unless some vital blow could be dealt him at home, there
was no forecasting the damage that he might not inflict on Persia by a
fresh invasion. Chosroes therefore made a desperate attempt to bring the
war to a close by an effort, the success of which would have changed the
history of the world. Having enrolled as soldiers, besides Persians,
a vast number of foreigners and slaves, and having concluded a close
alliance with the Khan of the Avars, he formed two great armies, one
of which was intended to watch Heraclius in Asia Minor, while the other
co-operated with the Avars and forced Constantinople to surrender. The
army destined to contend with the emperor was placed under the command
of Shahen; that which was to bear a part in the siege of Constantinople
was committed to Shahr-Barz. It is remarkable that Heraclius, though
quite aware of his adversary's plans, instead of seeking to baffle
them, made such arrangements as facilitated the attempt to put them
into execution. He divided his own troops into three bodies, one only of
which he sent to aid in the defence of his capital. The second body he
left with his brother Theodore, whom he regarded as a sufficient match
for Shahen. With the third division he proceeded eastward to the remote
province of Lazica, and there engaged in operations which could but very
slightly affect the general course of the war. The Khazars were once
more called in as allies; and their Khan, Ziebel, who coveted the
plunder of Tiflis, held an interview with the emperor in the sight of
the Persians who guarded that town, adored his majesty, and received
from his hands the diadem that adorned his own brow. Richly entertained,
and presented with all the plate used in the banquet, with a royal robe,
and a pair of pearl earrings, promised moreover the daughter of the
emperor (whose portrait he was shown) in marriage, the barbarian chief,
dazzled and flattered, readily concluded an alliance, and associated his
arms with those of the Romans. A joint attack was made upon Tiflis, and
the town was reduced to extremities; when Sarablagas, with a thousand
men, contrived to throw himself into it, and the allies, disheartened
thereby, raised the siege and retired.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, in Asia Minor, Theodore engaged the army of Shahen; and, a
violent hailstorm raging at the time, which drove into the enemy's face,
while the Romans were, comparatively speaking, sheltered from its force,
he succeeded in defeating his antagonist with great slaughter. Chosroes
was infuriated; and the displeasure of his sovereign weighed so heavily
upon the mind of Shahen that he shortly afterwards sickened and died.
The barbarous monarch gave orders that his corpse should be embalmed and
sent to the court, in order that he might gratify his spleen by treating
it with the grossest indignity.
</p>
<p>
At Constantinople the Persian cause was equally unsuccessful.
Shahr-Barz, from Chalcedon, entered into negotiations with the Khan of
the Avars, and found but little difficulty in persuading him to make
an attempt upon the imperial city. From their seats beyond the Danube
a host of barbarians&mdash;Avars, Slaves, Gepidas, Bulgarians, and
others&mdash;advanced through the passes of Heemus into the plains of Thrace,
destroying and ravaging. The population fled before them and sought the
protection of the city walls, which had been carefully strengthened in
expectation of the attack, and were in good order. The hordes forced the
outer works; but all their efforts, though made both by land and sea,
were unavailing against the main defences; their attempt to sap the wall
failed; their artillery was met and crushed by engines of greater power;
a fleet of Slavonian canoes, which endeavored to force an entrance by
the Golden Horn, was destroyed or driven ashore; the towers with which
they sought to overtop the walls were burnt; and, after ten days of
constantly repeated assaults, the barbarian leader became convinced
that he had undertaken an impossible enterprise, and, having burnt his
engines and his siege works, he retired. The result might have been
different had the Persians, who were experienced in the attack of walled
places, been able to co-operate with him; but the narrow channel which
flowed between Chalcedon and the Golden Horn proved an insurmountable
barrier; the Persians had no ships, and the canoes of the Slavonians
were quite unable to contend with the powerful galleys of the
Byzantines, so that the transport of a body of Persian troops from
Asia to Europe by their aid proved impracticable. Shahr-Barz had the
annoyance of witnessing the efforts and defeat of his allies, without
having it in his power to take any active steps towards assisting the
one or hindering the other.
</p>
<p>
The war now approached its termination; for the last hope of the
Persians had failed; and Heraclius, with his mind set at rest as
regarded his capital, was free to strike at any part of Persia that he
pleased, and, having the prestige of victory and the assistance of the
Khazars, was likely to carry all before him. It is not clear how he
employed himself during the spring and summer of A.D. 627; but in the
September of that year he started from Lazica with a large Roman army
and a contingent of 40,000 Khazar horse, resolved to surprise
his adversary by a winter campaign, and hoping to take him at a
disadvantage. Passing rapidly through Armenia and Azerbijan without
meeting an enemy that dared to dispute his advance, suffering no
loss except from the guerilla warfare of some bold spirits among
the mountaineers of those regions, he resolved, notwithstanding the
defection of the Khazars, who declined to accompany him further south
than Azerbijan, that he would cross the Zagros mountains into Assyria,
and make a dash at the royal cities of the Mesopotamian region, thus
retaliating upon Chosroes for the Avar attack upon Constantinople of the
preceding year, undertaken at his instigation. Chosroes himself had for
the last twenty-four years fixed his court at Dastagherd in the plain
country, about seventy miles to the north of Ctesiphon. It seemed to
Heraclius that this position might perhaps be reached, and an effective
blow struck against the Persian power. He hastened, therefore, to cross
the mountains; and the 9th of October saw him at Chnaethas, in the low
country, not far from Arbela, where he refreshed his army by a week's
rest. He might now easily have advanced along the great post-road which
connected Arbela with Dastagherd and Ctesiphon; but he had probably by
this time received information of the movements of the Persians, and was
aware that by so doing he would place himself between two fires, and
run the chance of being intercepted in his retreat. For Chosroes, having
collected a large force, had sent it, under Ehazates, a new general,
into Azerbijan; and this force, having reached Canzaca, found itself in
the rear of Heraclius, between him and Lazica. Heraclius appears not to
have thought it safe to leave this enemy behind him, and therefore he
idled away above a month in the Zab region, waiting for Ehazates to make
his appearance. That general had strict orders from the Great King
to fight the Romans wherever he found them, whatever might be the
consequence; and he therefore followed, as quickly as he could, upon
Heraclius's footsteps, and early in December came up with him in the
neighborhood of Nineveh. Both parties were anxious for an immediate
engagement, Rhazates to carry out his master's orders, Heraclius because
he had heard that his adversary would soon receive a reinforcement.
The battle took place on the 12th of December, in the open plain to the
north of Nineveh. It was contested from early dawn to the eleventh hour
of the day, and was finally decided, more by the accident that Rhazates
and the other Persian commanders were slain, than by any defeat of the
soldiers. Heraclius is said to have distinguished himself personally
during the fight by many valiant exploits; but he does not appear to
have exhibited any remarkable strategy on the occasion. The Persians
lost their generals, their chariots, and as many as twenty-eight
standards; but they were not routed, nor driven from the field. They
merely drew off to the distance of two bowshots, and there stood firm
till after nightfall. During the night they fell back further upon
their fortified camp, collected their baggage, and retired to a strong
position at the foot of the mountains. Here they were joined by
the reinforcement which Chosroes had sent to their aid; and thus
strengthened they ventured to approach Heraclius once more, to hang on
his rear, and impede his movements. He, after his victory, had resumed
his march southward, had occupied Nineveh, recrossed the Groat Zab,
advanced rapidly through Adiabene to the Lesser Zab, seized its bridges
by a forced march of forty-eight (Roman) miles, and conveyed his army
safely to its left bank, where he pitched his camp at a place called
Yesdem, and once more allowed his soldiers a brief repose for the
purpose of keeping Christmas. Chosroes had by this time heard of the
defeat and death of Rhazates, and was in a state of extreme alarm.
Hastily recalling Shahr-Barz from Chalcedon, and ordering the troops
lately commanded by Rhazates to outstrip the Romans, if possible, and
interpose themselves between Heraclius and Dastaghord, he took up
a strong position near that place with his own army and a number of
elephants, and expressed an intention of there awaiting his antagonist.
A broad and deep river, or rather canal, known as the Baras-roth or
Barazrud, protected his front; while at some distance further in advance
was the Torna, probably another canal, where he expected that the army
of Rhazates would make a stand. But that force, demoralized by its
recent defeat, fell back from the line of the Torna, without even
destroying the bridge over it; and Chosroes, finding the foe advancing
on him, lost heart, and secretly fled from Dastagherd to Ctesiphon,
whence he crossed the Tigris to Guedeseer or Seleucia, with his treasure
and the best-loved of his wives and children. The army lately under
Rhazates rallied upon the line of the Nahr-wan canal, three miles
from Ctesiphon; and here it was largely reinforced, though with a mere
worthless mob of slaves and domestics. It made however a formidable
show, supported by its elephants, which numbered two hundred; it had a
deep and wide cutting in its front; and, this time, it had taken care
to destroy all the bridges by which the cutting might have been crossed.
Heraclius, having plundered the rich palace of Dastagherd, together
with several less splendid royal residences, and having on the 10th of
January encamped within twelve miles of the Nahrwan, and learnt from
the commander of the Armenian contingent, whom he sent forward to
reconnoitre, that the canal was impassable, came to the conclusion that
his expedition had reached its extreme limit, and that prudence required
him to commence his retreat. The season had been, it would seem,
exceptionally mild, and the passes of the mountains were still open; but
it was to be expected that in a few weeks they would be closed by the
snow, which always falls heavily during some portion of the winter.
Heraclius, therefore, like Julian, having come within sight of
Ctesiphon, shrank from the idea of besieging it, and, content with
the punishment that he had inflicted on his enemy by wasting and
devastation, desisted from his expedition, and retraced his steps. In
his retreat he was more fortunate than his great predecessor. The defeat
which he had inflicted on the main army of the Persians paralyzed their
energies, and it would seem that his return march was unmolested. He
reached Siazurus (<i>Shehrizur</i>) early in February, Barzan (<i>Berozeh</i>)
probably on the 1st of March,176 and on the 11th of March Canzaca, where
he remained during the rest of the winter.
</p>
<p>
Chosroes had escaped a great danger, but he had incurred a terrible
disgrace. He had fled before his adversary without venturing to give
him battle. He had seen palace after palace destroyed, and had lost
the magnificent residence where he had held his court for the last
four-and-twenty years. The Romans had recovered 300 standards, trophies
gained in the numerous victories of his early years. They had shown
themselves able to penetrate into the heart of his empire, and to retire
without suffering any loss. Still, had he possessed a moderate amount
of prudence, Chosroes might even now have surmounted the perils of
his position, and have terminated his reign in tranquillity, if not
in glory. Heraclius was anxious for peace, and willing to grant it on
reasonable conditions. He did not aim at conquests, and would have been
contented at any time with the restoration of Egypt, Syria, and Asia
Minor. The Persians generally were weary of the war, and would have
hailed with joy almost any terms of accommodation. But Chosroes was
obstinate; he did not know how to bear the frowns of fortune; the
disasters of the late campaign, instead of bending his spirit, had
simply exasperated him, and he vented upon his own subjects the
ill-humor which the successes of his enemies had provoked. Lending a
too ready ear to a whispered slander, he ordered the execution of
Shahr-Barz, and thus mortally offended that general, to whom the
despatch was communicated by the Romans. He imprisoned the officers
who had been defeated by, or had fled before Heraclius. Several other
tyrannical acts are alleged against him; and it is said that he was
contemplating the setting aside of his legitimate successor, Siroes, in
favor of a younger son, Merdasas, his offspring by his favorite wife,
the Christian Shirin, when a rebellion broke out against his authority.
Gurdanaspa, who was in command of the Persian troops at Ctesiphon,
and twenty-two nobles of importance, including two sons of Shahr-Barz,
embraced the cause of Siroes, and seizing Chosroes, who meditated
flight, committed him to "the House of Darkness," a strong place where
he kept his money. Here he was confined for four days, his jailers
allowing him daily a morsel of bread and a small quantity of water; when
he complained of hunger, they told him, by his son's orders, that he
was welcome to satisfy his appetite by feasting upon his treasures. The
officers whom he had confined were allowed free access to his prison,
where they insulted him and spat upon him. Merdasas, the son whom he
preferred, and several of his other children, were brought into his
presence and put to death before his eyes. After suffering in this way
for four days he was at last, on the fifth day from his arrest (February
28), put to death in some cruel fashion, perhaps, like St. Sebastian,
by being transfixed with arrows. Thus perished miserably the second
Chosroes, after having reigned thirty-seven years (A.D. 591-628), a just
but tardy Nemesis overtaking the parricide.
</p>
<p>
The Oriental writers represent the second Chosroes as a monarch whose
character was originally admirable, but whose good disposition was
gradually corrupted by the possession of sovereign power. "Parviz," says
Mirkhond, "holds a distinguished rank among the kings of Persia through
the majesty and firmness of his government, the wisdom of his views, and
his intrepidity in carrying them out, the size of his army, the amount
of his treasure, the flourishing condition of the provinces during his
reign, the security of the highways, the prompt and exact obedience
which he enforced, and his unalterable adherence to the plans which
he once formed." It is impossible that these praises can have been
altogether undeserved; and we are bound to assign to this monarch, on
the authority of the Orientals, a vigor of administration, a strength
of will, and a capacity for governing, not very commonly possessed
by princes born in the purple. To these merits we may add a certain
grandeur of soul, and power of appreciating the beautiful and
the magnificent, which, though not uncommon in the East, did not
characterize many of the Sassanian sovereigns. The architectural remains
of Chosroes, which will be noticed in a future chapter, the descriptions
which have come down to us of his palaces at Dastagherd and Canzaca, the
accounts which we have of his treasures, his court, his seraglio, even
his seals, transcend all that is known of any other monarch of his line.
The employment of Byzantine sculptors and architects, which his works
are thought to indicate, implies an appreciation of artistic excellence
very rare among Orientals. But against these merits must be set a number
of most serious moral defects, which may have been aggravated as time
went on, but of which we see something more than the germ, even while
he was still a youth. The murder of his father was perhaps a state
necessity, and he may not have commanded it, or have been accessory
to it before the fact; but his ingratitude towards his uncles, whom he
deliberately put to death, is wholly unpardonable, and shows him to have
been cruel, selfish, and utterly without natural affection, even in the
earlier portion of his reign. In war he exhibited neither courage nor
conduct; all his main military successes were due to his generals; and
in his later years he seems never voluntarily to have exposed himself to
danger. In suspecting his generals, and ill-using them while living, he
only followed the traditions of his house; but the insults offered to
the dead body of Shahen, whose only fault was that he had suffered a
defeat, were unusual and outrageous. The accounts given of his seraglio
imply either gross sensualism or extreme ostentation; perhaps we may
be justified in inclining to the more lenient view, if we take into
consideration the faithful attachment which he exhibited towards Shirin.
The cruelties which disgraced his later years are wholly without excuse;
but in the act which deprived him of his throne, and brought him to a
miserable end&mdash;his preference of Merdasas as his successor&mdash;he exhibited
no worse fault than an amiable weakness, a partiality towards the son of
a wife who possessed, and seems to have deserved, his affection.
</p>
<p>
The coins of the second Chosroes are numerous in the extreme, and
present several peculiarities. The ordinary type has, on the obverse,
the king's head in profile, covered by a tiara, of which the chief
ornament is a crescent and star between two outstretched wings. The
head is surrounded by a double pearl bordering, outside of which, in the
margin, are three crescents and stars. The legend is <i>Khusrui afzud</i>,
with a monogram of doubtful meaning. The reverse shows the usual
fire altar and supporters, in a rude form, enclosed by a triple pearl
bordering. In the margin, outside the bordering, are four crescents and
stars. The legend is merely the regnal year and a mint-mark. Thirty-four
mint-marks have been ascribed to Chosroes II. <a href="#image-0004">[PLATE XXIII., Fig. 4.]</a>
</p>
<p>
A rarer and more curious type of coin, belonging to this monarch,
presents on the obverse the front face of the king, surmounted by a
mural crown, having the star and crescent between outstretched wings at
top. The legend is <i>Khusrui mallean malka&mdash;afzud</i>. "Chosroes, king of
kings&mdash;increase (be his)." The reverse has a head like that of a woman,
also fronting the spectator, and wearing a band enriched with pearls
across the forehead, above which the hair gradually converges to a
point. <a href="#image-0005">[PLATE XXIV., Fig. 1.]</a> A head very similar to this is found on
Indo-Sassanian coins. Otherwise we might have supposed that the uxorious
monarch had wished to circulate among his subjects the portrait of his
beloved Shirin.

</p>
<p>
Siroes, or Kobad the Second, as he is more properly termed, was
proclaimed king on the 25th of February, 2 A.D. 628, four days before
the murder of his father. According to the Oriental writers, he was very
unwilling to put his father to death, and only gave a reluctant consent
to his execution on the representations of his nobles that it was a
state of necessity. His first care, after this urgent matter had been
settled, was to make overtures of peace to Heraclius, who, having safely
crossed the Zagros mountains, was wintering at Canzaca. The letter which
he addressed to the Roman Emperor on the occasion is partially extant;
but the formal and official tone which it breathes renders it a somewhat
disappointing document. Kobad begins by addressing Heraclius as his
brother, and giving him the epithet of "most clement," thus assuming his
pacific disposition. He then declares, that, having been elevated to the
throne by the especial favor of God, he has resolved to do his utmost to
benefit and serve the entire human race. He has therefore commenced his
reign by throwing open the prison doors, and restoring liberty to
all who were detained in custody. With the same object in view, he is
desirous of living in peace and friendship with the Roman emperor and
state as well as with all other neighboring nations and kings. Assuming
that his accession will be pleasing to the emperor, he has sent Phaeak,
one of his privy councillors, to express the love and friendship that he
feels towards his brother, and learn the terms upon which peace will be
granted him. The reply of Heraclius is lost; but we are able to gather
from a short summary which has been preserved, as well as from the
subsequent course of events, that it was complimentary and favorable;
that it expressed the willingness of the emperor to bring the war to
a close, and suggested terms of accommodation that were moderate and
equitable. The exact formulation of the treaty seems to have been left
to Eustathius, who, after Heraclius had entertained Phaeak royally for
nearly a week, accompanied the ambassador on his return to the Persian
court.
</p>
<p>
The general principle upon which peace was concluded was evidently the
<i>status quo ante bellum</i>. Persia was to surrender Egypt, Palestine,
Syria, Asia Minor, Western Mesopotamia, and any other conquests that she
might have made from Rome, to recall her troops from them, and to give
them back into the possession of the Romans. She was also to surrender
all the captives whom she had carried off from the conquered countries;
and, above all, she was to give back to the Romans the precious relic
which had been taken from Jerusalem, and which was believed on all hands
to be the veritable cross whereon Jesus Christ suffered death. As Rome
had merely made inroads, but not conquests, she did not possess any
territory to surrender; but she doubtless set her Persian prisoners
free, and she made arrangements for the safe conduct and honorable
treatment of the Persians, who evacuated Syria, Egypt, and Asia Minor,
on their way to the frontier. The evacuation was at once commenced; and
the wood of the cross, which had been carefully preserved by the Persian
queen, Shirin, was restored. In the next year, Heraclius made a grand
pilgrimage to Jerusalem, and replaced the holy relic in the shrine from
which it had been taken.
</p>
<p>
It is said that princes are always popular on their coronation day.
Kobad was certainly no exception to the general rule. His subjects
rejoiced at the termination of a war which had always been a serious
drain on the population, and which latterly had brought ruin and
desolation upon the hearths and homes of thousands. The general emptying
of the prisons was an act that cannot be called statesman-like; but it
had a specious appearance of liberality, and was probably viewed with
favor by the mass of the people. A still more popular measure must have
been the complete remission of taxes with which Kobad inaugurated his
reign&mdash;a remission which, according to one authority, was to have
continued for three years, had the generous prince lived so long. In
addition to these somewhat questionable proceedings, Kobad adopted
also a more legitimate mode of securing the regard of his subjects by a
careful administration of justice, and a mild treatment of those who had
been the victims of his father's severities. He restored to their
former rank the persons whom Chosroes had degraded or imprisoned, and
compensated them for their injuries by a liberal donation of money.
</p>
<p>
Thus far all seemed to promise well for the new reign, which, though it
had commenced under unfavorable auspices, bid fair to be tranquil and
prosperous. In one quarter only was there any indication of coming
troubles. Shahr-Barz, the great general, whose life Chosroes
had attempted shortly before his own death, appears to have been
dissatisfied with the terms on which Kobad had concluded peace with
Rome; and there is even reason to believe that he contrived to impede
and delay the full execution of the treaty. He held under Kobad the
government of the western provinces and was at the head of an army
which numbered sixty thousand men. Kobad treated him with marked favor;
but still he occupied a position almost beyond that of a subject, and
one which could not fail to render him an object of fear and suspicion.
For the present, however, though he may have nurtured ambitious
thoughts, he made no movement, but bided his time, remaining quietly in
his province, and cultivating friendly relations with the Roman emperor.
</p>
<p>
Kobad had not been seated on the throne many months when he consented
to a deed by which his character for justice and clemency was seriously
compromised, if not wholly lost. This was the general massacre of all
the other sons of Chosroes II., his own brothers or half-brothers&mdash;a
numerous body, amounting to forty according to the highest estimate, and
to fifteen according to the lowest. We are not told of any circumstances
of peril to justify the deed, or even account for it. There have been
Oriental dynasties, where such a wholesale murder upon the accession of
a sovereign has been a portion of the established system of government,
and others where the milder but little less revolting expedient has
obtained of blinding all the brothers of the reigning prince; but
neither practice was in vogue among the Sassanians; and we look vainly
for the reason which caused an act of the kind to be resorted to at
this conjuncture. Mirkhond says that Piruz, the chief minister of Kobad,
advised the deed; but even he assigns no motive for the massacre, unless
a motive is implied in the statement that the brothers of Kobad
were "all of them distinguished by their talents and their merit."
Politically speaking, the measure might have been harmless, had Kobad
enjoyed a long reign, and left behind him a number of sons. But as it
was, the rash act, by almost extinguishing the race of Sassan, produced
troubles which greatly helped to bring the empire into a condition of
hopeless exhaustion and weakness.
</p>
<p>
While thus destroying all his brothers, Kobad allowed his sisters to
live. Of these there were two, still unmarried, who resided in the
palace, and had free access to the monarch. Their names were Purandocht
and Azermidocht, Purandocht being the elder. Bitterly grieved at the
loss of their kindred, these two princesses rushed into the royal
presence, and reproached the king with words that cut him to the soul.
"Thy ambition of ruling," they said, "has induced thee to kill thy
father and thy brothers. Thou hast accomplished thy purpose within the
space of three or four months. Thou hast hoped thereby to preserve thy
power forever. Even, however, if thou shouldst live long, thou must die
at last. May God deprive thee of the enjoyment of this royalty!" His
sisters' words sank deep into the king's mind. He acknowledged their
justice, burst into tears, and flung his crown on the ground. After this
he fell into a profound melancholy, ceased to care for the exercise of
power, and in a short time died. His death is ascribed by the Orientals
to his mental sufferings; but the statement of a Christian bishop throws
some doubt on this romantic story. Eutychius, Patriarch of Alexandria,
tells us that, before Kobad had reigned many months, the plague broke
out in his country. Vast numbers of his subjects died of it; and among
the victims was the king himself, who perished after a reign which is
variously estimated at six, seven, eight, and eighteen months.
</p>
<p>
There seems to be no doubt that a terrible pestilence did afflict Persia
at this period. The Arabian writers are here in agreement with Eutychius
of Alexandria, and declare that the malady was of the most aggravated
character, carrying off one half, or at any rate one third, of the
inhabitants of the provinces which were affected, and diminishing the
population of Persia by several hundreds of thousands. Scourges of this
kind are of no rare occurrence in the East; and the return of a mixed
multitude to Persia, under circumstances involving privation, from
the cities of Asia Minor, Syria, and Palestine, was well calculated to
engender such a calamity.
</p>
<p>
The reign of Kobad II. appears from his coins to have lasted above a
year. He ascended the throne in February, A.D. 628; he probably died
about July, A.D. 629. The coins which are attributed to him resemble in
their principal features those of Ohosroes II. and Artaxerxes III., but
are without wings, and have the legend <i>Kavat-Firuz</i>. The bordering
of pearls is single on both obverse and reverse, but the king wears a
double pearl necklace. The eye is large, and the hair more carefully
marked than had been usual since the time of Sapor II. <a href="#image-0005">[PLATE XXIV.,
Figs. 2 and 3].</a>
</p>
<p>
At the death of Kobad the crown fell to his son, Artaxerxes III., a
child of seven, or (according to others) of one year only. The nobles
who proclaimed him took care to place him under the direction of a
governor or regent, and appointed to the office a certain Mihr-Hasis,
who had been the chief purveyor of Kobad. Mihr-Hasis is said to have
ruled with justice and discretion; but he was not able to prevent the
occurrence of those troubles and disorders which in the East almost
invariably accompany the sovereignty of a minor, and render the task
of a regent a hard one. Shahr-Barz, who had scarcely condescended to
comport himself as a subject under Kobad, saw in the accession of a
boy, and in the near extinction of the race of Sassan, an opportunity
of gratifying his ambition, and at the same time of avenging the wrong
which had been done him by Chosroes. Before committing himself, however,
to the perils of rebellion, he negotiated with Heraclius, and secured
his alliance and support by the promise of certain advantages. The
friends met at Heraclea on the Propontis. Shahr-Barz undertook to
complete the evacuation of Egypt, Syria, and Asia Minor, which he had
delayed hitherto, and promised, if he were successful in his enterprise,
to pay Heraclius a large sum of money as compensation for the injuries
inflicted on Rome during the recent war. Heraclius conferred on Nicetas,
the son of Shahr-Barz, the title of "Patrican," consented to a marriage
between Shahr-Barz's daughter, Nike, and his own son, Theodosius,
and accepted Gregoria, the daughter of Nicetas, and grand-daughter of
Shahr-Barz, as a wife for Constantine, the heir to the empire. He also,
it is probable, supplied Shahr-Barz with a body of troops, to assist him
in his struggle with Artaxerxes and Mihr-Hasis.
</p>
<p>
Of the details of Sharhr-Barz's expedition we know nothing. He is said
to have marched on Ctesiphon with an army of sixty thousand men; to have
taken the city, put to death Artaxerxes, Mihr-Hasis, and a number of the
nobles, and then seized the throne. We are not told what resistance
was made by the monarch in possession, or how it was overcome, or even
whether there was a battle. It would seem certain, however, that the
contest was brief. The young king was of course powerless; Mihr-Hasis,
though well-meaning, must have been weak; Shahr-Barz had all the rude
strength of the animal whose name he bore, and had no scruples about
using his strength to the utmost. The murder of a child of two, or at
the most of eight, who could have done no ill, and was legitimately in
possession of the throne, must be pronounced a brutal act, and one which
sadly tarnishes the fair fame, previously unsullied, of one of Persia's
greatest generals.
</p>
<p>
It was easy to obtain the crown, under the circumstances of the
time; but it was not so easy to keep what had been wrongfully gained.
Shahr-Barz enjoyed the royal authority less than two months. During this
period he completed the evacuation of the Roman provinces occupied by
Chosroes II., restored perhaps some portions of the true cross which
had been kept back by Kobad, and sent an expeditionary force against the
Khazars who had invaded Armenia, which was completely destroyed by
the fierce barbarians. He is said by the Armenians to have married
Purandocht, the eldest daughter of Chosroes, for the purpose of
strengthening his hold on the crown; but this attempt to conciliate his
subjects, if it was really made, proved unsuccessful. Ere he had been
king for two months, his troops mutinied, drew their swords upon him,
and killed him in the open court before the palace. Having so done, they
tied a cord to his feet and dragged his corpse through the streets of
Ctesiphon, making proclamation everywhere as follows: "Whoever, not
being of the blood-royal, seats himself upon the Persian throne, shall
share the fate of Shahr-Barz." They then elevated to the royal dignity
the princess Purandocht, the first female who had ever sat in the seat
of Cyrus.
</p>
<p>
The rule of a woman was ill calculated to restrain the turbulent Persian
nobles. Two instances had now proved that a mere noble might ascend the
throne of the son of Babek; and a fatal fascination was exercised on
the grandees of the kingdom by the examples of Bahram-Chobin and
Shahr-Barz.
</p>
<p>
Pretenders sprang up in all quarters, generally asserting some
connection, nearer or more remote, with the royal house, but relying
on the arms of their partisans, and still more on the weakness of the
government. It is uncertain whether Purandocht died a natural death; her
sister, Azermidocht, who reigned soon after her, was certainly murdered.
The crown passed rapidly from one noble to another, and in the course of
the four or five years which immediately succeeded the death of Chosroes
II. it was worn by nine or ten different persons. Of these the greater
number reigned but a few days or a few months; no actions are ascribed
to them; and it seems unnecessary to weary the reader with their obscure
names, or with the still more obscure question concerning the order of
their succession. It may be suspected that, in some cases two or more
were contemporary, exercising royal functions in different portions
of the empire at the same time. Of none does the history or the fate
possess any interest; and the modern historical student may well be
content with the general knowledge that for four years and a half after
the death of Chosroes II. the government was in the highest degree
unsettled; anarchy everywhere prevailed; the distracted kingdom was
torn in pieces by the struggles of pretenders; and "every province, and
almost each city of Persia, was the scene of independence, of discord,
and of bloodshed."
</p>
<p>
At length, in June, A.D. 632, an end was put to the internal commotions
by the election of a young prince, believed to be of the true blood
of Sassan, in whose rule the whole nation acquiesced without much
difficulty. Yezdigerd (or Isdigerd) the Third was the son of Shahriar
and the grandson of Chosroes II. He had been early banished from the
Court, and had been brought up in obscurity, his royal birth being
perhaps concealed, since if known it might have caused his destruction.
The place of his residence was Istakr, the ancient capital of Persia,
but at this time a city of no great importance. Here he had lived
unnoticed to the age of fifteen, when his royal rank having somehow been
discovered, and no other scion of the stock of Chosroes being known
to exist, he was drawn forth from his retirement and invested with the
sovereignty.
</p>
<p>
But the appointment of a sovereign in whose rule all could acquiesce
came too late. While Rome and Persia, engaged in deadly struggle, had no
thought for anything but how most to injure each other, a power began
to grow up in an adjacent country, which had for long ages been despised
and thought incapable of doing any harm to its neighbors. Mohammed, half
impostor, half enthusiast, enunciated a doctrine, and by degrees worked
out a religion, which proved capable of uniting in one the scattered
tribes of the Arabian desert, while at the same time it inspired them
with a confidence, a contempt for death, and a fanatic valor, that
rendered them irresistible by the surrounding nations. Mohammed's career
as prophet began while Heraclius and Chosroes II. were flying at each
other's throats; by the year of the death of Chosroes (A.D. 628) he had
acquired a strength greater than that of any other Arab chief; two years
later he challenged Rome to the combat by sending a hostile expedition
into Syria; and before his death (A.D. 632) he was able to take the
field at the head of 30,000 men. During the time of internal trouble in
Persia he procured the submission of the Persian governor of the Yemen;
as well as that of Al Mondar, or Alamundarus, King of Bahrein, on the
west coast of the Persian Gulf. Isdigerd, upon his accession, found
himself menaced by a power which had already stretched out one arm
towards the lower Euphrates, while with the other it was seeking to
grasp Syria and Palestine. The danger was imminent; the means of meeting
it insufficient, for Persia was exhausted by foreign war and internal
contention; the monarch himself was but ill able to cope with the Arab
chiefs, being youthful and inexperienced; we shall find, however,
that he made a strenuous resistance. Though continually defeated, he
prolonged the fight for nearly a score of years, and only succumbed
finally when, to the hostility of open foes, was added the treachery of
pretended friends and allies.

"Yazdejird, Persarum rex.... Rostamum misit oppugnatum Saadum... neque
unquam belloram et dissentionum expers fuit, donee oecideretur. Regnavit
autem annos viginti."&mdash;Eutychius, <i>Annales</i>, vol. ii. pp. 295-6.
</p>
<p>
The power which Mohammed had so rapidly built up fell to pieces at his
decease. Isdigerd can scarcely have been well settled upon this throne
when the welcome tidings must have reached him that the Prophet was
dead, that the Arabs generally were in revolt, that Al Mondar had
renounced Islamism and resumed a position of independence. For the
time Mohammedanism was struck down. It remained to be seen whether the
movement had derived its strength solely from the genius of the Prophet,
or whether minds of inferior calibre would suffice to renew and sustain
the impulse which had proceeded from him, and which under him had proved
of such wonderful force and efficacy.
</p>
<p>
The companions of Mohammed lost no time in appointing his successor.
Their choice fell upon Abu-bekr, his friend and father-in-law, who was a
person of an energetic character, brave, chaste, and temperate. Abu-bekr
proved himself quite equal to the difficulties of the situation. Being
unfit for war himself, as he was above sixty years of age, he employed
able generals, and within a few months of his accession struck such a
series of blows that rebellion collapsed everywhere, and in a short
time the whole Arab nation, except the tribe of Gassan, acknowledged
themselves his subjects. Among the rivals against whom he measured
himself, the most important was Moseilama. Moseilama, who affected the
prophetic character, had a numerous following, and was able to fight a
pitched battle with the forces of Abu-bekr, which numbered 40,000 men.
At the first encounter he even succeeded in repulsing this considerable
army, which lost 1200 warriors; but in a second engagement the
Mohammedans were victorious&mdash;Moseilama was slain&mdash;and Kaled, "the Sword
of God," carried back to Medina the news of his own triumph, and the
spoils of the defeated enemy. Soon after the fall of Moseilama, the
tribes still in rebellion submitted themselves, and the first of the
Caliphs found himself at liberty to enter upon schemes of foreign
conquest.
</p>
<p>
Distracted between the temptations offered to his arms by the East and
by the West, Abu-bekr in his first year (A.D. 633) sent expeditions
in both directions, against Syria, and against Hira, where Iyas, the
Persian feudatory, who had succeeded Noman, son of Al Mondar, held
his court, on the western branch of the Euphrates. For this latter
expedition the commander selected was the irresistible Kaled, who
marched a body of 2000 men across the desert to the branch stream,s
which he reached in about latitude 30. Assisted by Al Mothanna, chief
of the Beni Sheiban, who had been a subject of Iyas, but had revolted
and placed himself under the protection of Abu-bekr, Kaled rapidly
reduced the kingdom of Hira, took successively Banikiya, Barasuilia,
and El Lis, descended the river to the capital, and there fought an
important battle with the combined Persian and Arab forces, the first
trial of arms between the followers of Mohammed and those of Zoroaster.
The Persian force consisted entirely of horse, and was commanded by
a general whom the Arab writers call Asadsubeh. Their number is not
mentioned, but was probably small. Charged furiously by Al Mothanna,
they immediately broke and fled; Hira was left with no other protection
than its walls; and Iyas, yielding to necessity, made his submission to
the conqueror, and consented to pay a tribute of 290,000 dirhems.
</p>
<p>
The splendid success of his pioneer induced Abu-bekr to support the war
in this quarter with vigor. Reinforcements joined Kaled from every side,
and in a short time he found himself at the head of an army of 18,000
men. With this force he proceeded southwards bent on reducing the entire
tract between the desert and the Eastern or real Euphrates. The most
important city of the southern region was at the time Obolla which was
situated on a canal or backwater derived from the Euphrates, not far
from the modern Busrah. It was the great emporium for the Indian trade,
and was known as the <i>limes Indorum</i> or "frontier city towards India."
The Persian governor was a certain Hormuz or Hormisdas who held the
post with 20,000 men. Kaled fought his second great battle with this
antagonist, and was once more completely victorious, killing Hormuz,
according to the Arabian accounts, with his own hands. Obolla
surrendered; a vast booty was taken; and, after liberally rewarding
his soldiers Kaled sent the fifth part of the spoils, together with a
captured elephant, to Abu-bekr at Medina. The strange animal astonished
the simple natives, who asked one another wonderingly "Is this indeed
one of God's works, or did human art make it."
</p>
<p>
The victories of Kaled Over Asadsubeh and Hormuz were followed by a
number of other successes, the entire result being that the whole of
the fertile region on the right bank of the Euphrates from Hit to the
Persian Gulf, was for the time reduced, made a portion of Ahu-bekr's
dominions, and parcelled out among Mohammedan governors. Persia was
deprived of the protection which a dependent Arab kingdom to the west of
the river had hitherto afforded her, and was brought into direct contact
with the great Mohammedan monarchy along almost the whole of her western
frontier. Henceforth she was open to attack on this side for a distance
of above four hundred miles, with no better barrier than a couple of
rivers interposed between her enemy and her capital.
</p>
<p>
Soon after his conquest of the kingdom of Hira, Kaled was recalled
from the Euphrates to the Syrian war, and was employed in the siege of
Damascus, while Persia enjoyed a breathing-space. Advantage was taken of
this interval to stir up disaffection in the newly-conquered province.
Rustam appointed to the command against the Arabs by Isdigerd sent
emissaries to the various towns of the Sawad, urging them to rise in
revolt and promising to support such a movement with a Persian army. The
situation was critical; and if the Mohammedans had been less tenacious,
or the Persians more skilfully handled, the whole of the Sawad might
have been recovered. But Rustam allowed his troops to be defeated in
detail. Al Mothanna and Abu Obediah, in three separate engagements, at
Namarik, Sakatiya, and Barusma, overcame the Persian leaders, Jaban,
Narses, and Jalenus, and drove their shattered armies back on the
Tigris. The Mohammedan authority was completely re-established in the
tract between the desert and the Euphrates; it was even extended across
the Euphrates into the tract watered by the Shat-el-Hie; and it soon
became a question whether Persia would be able to hold the Mesopotamian
region, or whether the irrepressible Arabs would not very shortly
wrest it from her grasp. But at this point in the history the Arabs
experienced a severe reverse. On learning the defeat of his lieutenants,
Rustam sent an army to watch the enemy, under the command of
Bahman-Dsul-hadjib, or "Bahman the beetle-browed," which encamped upon
the Western Euphrates at Kossen-natek, not far from the site of Kufa.
At the same time, to raise the courage of the soldiers, he entrusted to
this leader the sacred standard of Persia, the famous <i>durufsh-kawani</i>,
or leathern apron of the blacksmith Kawah, which was richly adorned
with silk and gems, and is said to have measured, eighteen feet long
by twelve feet broad. Bahman had with him, according to the Persian
tradition, 30,000 men and thirty elephants; the Arabs under Abu Obediah
numbered no more than 9000, or at the most 10,000. Bahman is reported
to have given his adversary the alternative of passing the Euphrates
or allowing the Persians to cross it. Abu Obediah preferred the bolder
course, and, in spite of the dissuasions of his chief officers, threw
a bridge of boats across the stream, and so conveyed his troops to the
left bank. Here he found the Persian horse-archers covered with their
scale armor, and drawn up in a solid line behind their elephants. Galled
severely by the successive flights of arrows, the Arab cavalry sought
to come to close quarters; but their horses, terrified by the unwonted
sight of the huge animals, and further alarmed by the tinkling of the
bells hung round their necks, refused to advance. It was found necessary
to dismount, and assail the Persian line on foot. A considerable
impression had been made, and it was thought that the Persians would
take to flight, when Abu Obediah, in attacking the most conspicuous of
the elephants, was seized by the infuriated animal and trampled under
his feet. Inspirited by this success, the Persians rushed upon their
enemies, who, disheartened by the loss of their commander, began a
retrograde movement, falling back upon their newly-made bridge. This,
however, was found to have been broken, either by the enemy, or by a
rash Arab who thought, by making retreat impossible, to give his own
side the courage of despair. Before the damage done could be repaired,
the retreating host suffered severely. The Persians pressed closely
upon them, slew many, and drove others into the stream, where they were
drowned. Out of the 9000 or 10,000 who originally passed the river,
only 5000 returned, and of these 2000 at once dispersed to their homes.
Besides Abu Obediah, the veteran Salit was slain; and Al Mothanna, who
succeeded to the command on Abu Obediah's death, was severely wounded.
The last remnant of the defeated army might easily have been destroyed,
had not a dissension arisen among the Persians, which induced Bahman to
return to Otesiphon.
</p>
<p>
The Arabs, upon this repulse, retired to El Lis; and Al Mothanna sent
to Omar for reinforcements, which speedily arrived under the command
of Jarir, son of Abdallah. Al Mothanna was preparing to resume the
offensive when the Persians anticipated him. A body of picked troops,
led by Mihran a general of reputation, crossed the Euphrates, and made a
dash at Hira. Hastily collecting his men, who were widely dispersed, Al
Mothanna gave the assailants battle on the canal El Boweib, in the near
vicinity of the threatened town, and though the Persians fought with
desperation from noon to sunset, succeeded in defeating them and in
killing their commander. The beaten army recrossed the Euphrates, and
returned to Otesiphon without suffering further losses, since the Arabs
were content to have baffled their attack, and did not pursue them many
miles from the field of battle. All Mesopotamia, however, was by this
defeat laid open to the invaders, whose ravages soon extended to the
Tigris and the near vicinity of the capital.
</p>
<p>
The year A.D. 636 now arrived, and the Persians resolved upon an
extraordinary effort. An army of 120,000 men was enrolled, and Rustam,
reckoned the best general of the day, was placed at its head. The
Euphrates was once more crossed, the Sawad entered, its inhabitants
invited to revolt, and the Arab force, which had been concentrated at
Cadesia (Kadisiyeh), where it rested upon a fortified town, was sought
out and challenged to the combat. The Caliph Omar had by great efforts
contrived to raise his troops in the Sawad to the number of 30,000, and
had entrusted the command of them to Sa'ad, the son of Wakas, since Al
Mothanna had died of his wound. Sa'ad stood wholly on the defensive. His
camp was pitched outside the walls of Cadesia, in a position protected
on either side by a canal, or branch stream, derived from the Euphrates,
and flowing to the south-east out of the Sea of Nedjef. He himself,
prevented by boils from sitting on his horse, looked down on his troops,
and sent them directions from the Oadesian citadel. Rustam, in order
to come to blows, was obliged to fill up the more eastern of the branch
streams (El Atik), with reeds and earth, and in this way to cross the
channel. The Arabs made no attempt to hinder the operation; and the
Persian general, having brought his vast army directly opposite to
the enemy, proceeded to array his troops as he thought most expedient.
Dividing his army into a centre and two wings, he took himself the
position of honor in, the mid-line with nineteen elephants and three
fifths of his forces, while he gave the command of the right wing to
Jalenus, and of the left to Bendsuwan; each of whom we may suppose to
have had 24,000 troops and seven elephants. The Arabs, on their side,
made no such division. Kaled, son of Orfuta, was the sole leader in the
fight, though Sa'ad from his watch-tower observed the battle and gave
his orders. The engagement began at mid-day and continued till sunset.
At the signal of <i>Allah akbar</i>, "God is great," shouted by Sa'ad from
his tower, the Arabs rushed to the attack. Their cavalry charged; but
the Persians advanced against them their line of elephants, repeating
with excellent effect the tactics of the famous "Battle of the Bridge."
The Arab horse fled; the foot alone remained firm; victory seemed
inclining to the Persians, who were especially successful on either
wing; Toleicha, with his "lions" failed to re-establish the balance; and
all would have been lost, had not Assem, at the command of Sa'ad, sent a
body of archers and other footmen to close with the elephants, gall them
with missiles, cut their girths, and so precipitate their riders to the
ground. Relieved from this danger, the Arab horse succeeded in repulsing
the Persians, who as evening approached retired in good order to their
camp. The chief loss on this, the "day of concussion," was suffered
by the Arabs, who admit that they had 500 killed, and must have had a
proportional number of wounded.
</p>
<p>
On the morning of the second day the site of the battle was somewhat
changed, the Persians having retired a little during the night.
Reinforcements from Syria kept reaching the Arab camp through most
of the day; and hence it is known to the Arab writers as the "day of
succors." The engagement seems for some time not to have been general,
the Arabs waiting for more troops to reach them, while the Persians
abstained because they had not yet repaired the furniture of their
elephants. Thus the morning passed in light skirmishes and single
combats between the champions of either host, who went out singly before
the lines and challenged each other to the encounter. The result of the
duels was adverse to the Persians, who lost in the course of them two of
their best generals, Bendsuwan and Bahman-Dsulhadjib. After a time the
Arabs, regarding themselves as sufficiently reinforced, attacked the
Persians along their whole line, partly with horse, and partly with
camels, dressed up to resemble elephants. The effect on the Persian
cavalry was the same as had on the preceding day been produced by the
real elephants on the horse of the Arabs; it was driven off the field
and dispersed, suffering considerable losses. But the infantry stood
firm, and after a while the cavalry rallied; Rustam, who had been in
danger of suffering capture, was saved; and night closing in, defeat was
avoided, though the advantage of the day rested clearly with the Arabs.
The Persians had lost 10,000 in killed and wounded, the Arabs no more
than 2000.
</p>
<p>
In the night which followed "the day of succors" great efforts were made
by the Persians to re-equip their elephants, and when morning dawned
they were enabled once more to bring the unwieldy beasts into line. But
the Arabs and their horses had now grown more familiar with the strange
animals; they no longer shrank from meeting them; and some Persian
deserters gave the useful information that, in order to disable the
brutes it was only necessary to wound them on the proboscis or in the
eye. Thus instructed, the Arabs made the elephants the main object of
their attack, and, having wounded the two which were accustomed to lead
the rest, caused the whole body on a sudden to take to flight, cross the
canal El Atik, and proceed at full speed to Ctesiphon. The armies then
came to close quarters; and the foot and horse contended through the
day with swords and spears, neither side being able to make any serious
impression upon the other. As night closed in, however, the Persians
once more fell back, crossing the canal El Atik, and so placing that
barrier between themselves and their adversaries.
</p>
<p>
Their object in this manoeuvre was probably to obtain the rest which
they must have greatly needed. The Persians were altogether of a frame
less robust, and of a constitution less hardy, than the Arabs. Their
army at Kadisiyeh was, moreover, composed to a large extent of raw
recruits; and three consecutive days of severe fighting must have sorely
tried its endurance. The Persian generals hoped, it would seem, by
crossing the Atik to refresh their troops with a quiet night before
renewing the combat on the morrow. But the indefatigable Arabs, perhaps
guessing their intention, determined to frustrate it, and prevented
the tired host from enjoying a moment's respite. The "day of embittered
war," as it was called, was followed by the "night of snarling"&mdash;a time
of horrid noise and tumult, during which the discordant cries of the
troops on either side were thought to resemble the yells and barks of
dogs and jackals. Two of the bravest of the Arabs, Toleicha and Amr,
crossed the Atik with small bodies of troops, and under cover of the
darkness entered the Persian camp, slew numbers, and caused the greatest
confusion. By degrees a general engagement was brought on, which
continued into the succeeding day, so that the "night of snarling" can
scarcely be separated from the "day of cormorants"&mdash;the last of the four
days' Kadisiyeh fight.
</p>
<p>
It would seem that the Persians must on the fourth day have had for a
time the advantage, since we find them once more fighting upon the old
ground, in the tract between the two canals, with the Atik in their
rear. About noon, however, a wind arose from the west, bringing with
it clouds of sand, which were blown into the faces and eyes of the
Persians, while the Arabs, having their backs to the storm, suffered but
little from its fury. Under these circumstances the Moslems made fresh
efforts, and after a while a part of the Persian army was forced to
give ground. Hormuzan, satrap of Susiana, and Firuzan, the general who
afterwards commanded at Nehavend, fell back. The line of battle was
dislocated; the person of the commander became exposed to danger; and
about the same time a sudden violent gust tore away the awning that
shaded his seat, and blew it into the Atik, which was not far off.
Rustam sought a refuge from the violence of the storm among his baggage
mules, and was probably meditating flight, when the Arabs were upon him.
Hillal, son of Alkama, intent upon plunder, began to cut the cords of
the baggage and strew it upon the ground. A bag falling severely injured
Rustam, who threw himself into the Atik and attempted to swim across.
Hillal, however, rushed after him, drew him to shore, and slew him;
after which he mounted the vacant throne, and shouted as loudly as
he could, "By the lord of the Kaaba, I have killed Rustam." The words
created a general panic. Everywhere the Persian courage fell; the most
part despaired wholly, and at once took to flight; a few cohorts alone
stood firm and were cut to pieces; the greater number of the men rushed
hastily to the Atik; some swam the stream others crossed where it
had been filled up; but as many as 30,000 perished in the waves.
Ten thousand had fallen on the field of battle in the course of the
preceding night and day, while of the Mohammedans as many as 6000
had been slain. Thus the last day of the Kadisiyeh fight was stoutly
contested; and the Persian defeat was occasioned by no deficiency
of courage, but by the occurrence of a sand-storm and by the almost
accidental death of the commander. Among the Persian losses in the
battle that of the national standard, the <i>durufsh-kawani</i> was reckoned
the most serious.
</p>
<p>
The retreat of the defeated army was conducted by Jalenus. Sa'ad,
anxious to complete his victory, sent three bodies of troops across the
Atik, to press upon the flying foe. One of these, commanded by Sohra,
came up with the Persian rear-guard under Jalenus at Harrar, and
slaughtered it, together with its leader. The other two seem to have
returned without effecting much. The bulk of the fugitives traversed
Mesopotamia in safety, and found a shelter behind the walls of
Ctesiphon.
</p>
<p>
By the defeat of Kadisiyeh all hope of recovering the territory on the
right bank of the Euphrates was lost; but Persia did not as yet despair
of maintaining her independence. It was evident, indeed, that the
permanent maintenance of the capital was henceforth precarious; and a
wise forethought would have suggested the removal of the Court from so
exposed a situation and its transference to some other position, either
to Istakr, the ancient metropolis of Persia Proper, or to Hamadan, the
capital city of Media. But probably it was considered that to retire
voluntarily from the Tigris would be a confession of weakness, as fatal
to the stability of the empire as to be driven back by the Arabs; and
perhaps it may have been hoped that the restless nomads would be content
with their existing conquests, or that they might receive a check at the
hands of Rome which would put a stop to their aggressions elsewhere.
It is remarkable that, during the pause of a year and a half which
intervened between the battle of Kadisiyeh and the resumption of
hostilities by the Arabs, nothing seems to have been done by Persia in
the way of preparation against her terrible assailants.
</p>
<p>
In the year A.D. 637 the Arabs again took the offensive. They had
employed the intervening year and a half in the foundation of Busrah and
Kufam and in the general consolidation of their sway on the right bank
of the Euphrates. They were now prepared for a further movement. The
conduct of the war was once more entrusted to Sa'ad. Having collected
an army of 20,000 men, this general proceeded from Kufa to Anbar
(or Perisabor), where he crossed the Euphrates, and entered on the
Mesopotamian region. Isdigerd. learning that he had put his forces in
motion, and was bent upon attacking Ctesiphon, called a council of
war, and asked its advice as to the best course to be pursued under
the circumstances. It was generally agreed that the capital must be
evacuated, and a stronger situation in the more mountainous part of the
country occupied; but Isdigerd was so unwilling to remove that he waited
till the Arabian general, with a force now raised to 60,000, had reached
Sabat, which was only a day's march from the capital, before he could
be induced to commence his retreat. He then abandoned the town hastily,
without carrying off more than a small portion of the treasures which
his ancestors had during four centuries accumulated at the main seat
of their power, and retired to Holwan, a strong place in the Zagros
mountain-range. Sa'ad, on learning his movement, sent a body of troops
in pursuit, which came up with the rear-guard of the Persians, and cut
it in pieces, but effected nothing really important. Isdigerd made good
his retreat, and in a short time concentrated at Holwan an army of above
100,000 men. Sa'ad, instead of pushing forward and engaging this force,
was irresistibly attracted by the reputed wealth of the Great Ctesiphon,
and, marching thither, entered the unresisting city, with his troops, in
the sixteenth year of the Hegira, the four hundred and eleventh from the
foundation of the Sassanian kingdom by Artaxerxes, son of Babek.
</p>
<p>
Ctesiphon was, undoubtedly, a rich prize. Its palaces and its gardens,
its opulent houses and its pleasant fields, its fountains and its
flowers, are celebrated by the Arabian writers, who are never weary of
rehearsing the beauty of its site, the elegance of the buildings,
the magnificence and luxury of their furniture, or the amount of the
treasures which were contained in them. The royal palace, now known as
the Takht-i-Khosru, especially provoked their admiration. It was built
of polished stone, and had in front of it a portico of twelve marble
pillars, each 150 feet high. The length of the edifice was 450 feet, its
breadth 180, its height 150. In the centre was the hall of audience, a
noble apartment, 115 feet long and 85 high, with a magnificent vaulted
roof, bedecked with golden stars, so arranged as to represent the
motions of the planets among the twelve signs of the Zodiac, where the
monarch was accustomed to sit on a golden throne, hearing causes
and dispensing justice to his subjects. The treasury and the various
apartments were full of gold and silver, of costly robes and precious
stones, of jewelled arms and dainty carpets. The glass vases of the
spice magazine contained an abundance of musk, camphor, amber, gums,
drugs, and delicious perfumes. In one apartment was found a carpet
of white brocade, 450 feet long and 90 broad, with a border worked in
precious stones of various hues, to represent a garden of all kinds of
beautiful flowers. The leaves were formed of emeralds, the blossoms
and buds of pearls, rubies, sapphires, and other gems of immense value.
Among the objects found in the treasury were a horse made entirely of
gold, bearing a silver saddle set with a countless multitude of jewels,
and a camel made of silver, accompanied by a foal of which the material
was gold. A coffer belonging to Isdigerd was captured at the bridge over
the Nahrwan canal as its guardians were endeavoring to carry it off.
Among its contents were a robe of state embroidered with rubies and
pearls, several garments made of tissue of gold, the crown and seal of
Chosroes (Anushirwan?), and ten pieces of silk brocade. The armory of
Chosroes also fell into the conqueror's hands. It contained his helmet,
breastplate, greaves, and arm-pieces, all of solid gold adorned with
pearls, six "cuirasses of Solomon," and ten costly scimitars. The works
of art, and a fifth part of the entire booty, were set apart for the
Caliph Omar, and sent by trusty messengers to Medina; the value of the
remainder was so enormous that when Sa'ad divided it among his 60,000
soldiers the share of each amounted to 12,000 dirhems (L312.).
</p>
<p>
It is said that Sa'ad, after capturing Ctesiphon, was anxious to set out
in pursuit of Isdigerd, but was restrained by dispatches received from
Omar, which commanded him to remain at the Persian capital, and to
employ his brother Hashem, and the experienced general, El Kakaa, in the
further prosecution of the war. Hashem was, therefore, sent with 12,000
men, against the fugitive monarch, whose forces, said to have exceeded
100,000 men, and commanded by a Mihran, were drawn up at Jalula, not
far from Holwan. The disparity of numbers forced Hashem to condescend
to maneuvering; and it was six months before he ventured on a general
engagement with his antagonist. Again the Mohammedans proved victorious;
and this time the carnage was excessive; 100,000 Persians are said to
have lain dead on the battle-field; the commander was himself among the
slain. Jalula at once surrendered; and fresh treasures were obtained.
Among other precious articles, a figure of a camel, with its rider,
in solid gold, was found in one of the tents. Altogether the booty is
reckoned at about four millions of our money&mdash;the share of each soldier
engaged being 10,000 dirhems, or about L260. sterling.
</p>
<p>
Isdigerd, on learning the result of the battle of Jalula, quitted
Holwan, and retired to Rei, a large town near the Caspian sea, at a
short distance from the modern Teheran, thus placing the entire Zagros
range between himself and his irresistible foes. A general named
Khosru-sum was left behind with a large body of troops, and was bidden
to defend Holwan to the last extremity. Instead of remaining, however,
within the walls of the stronghold, Khosru-sum rashly led his force to
meet that of El Kakaa, who defeated him at Kasr-i-Shirin and entirely
dispersed his army. Holwan, being left without protection, surrendered;
the conquest of Shirwan, Mahsabadan, and Tekrit followed; and by the
close of the year A.D. 637 the banner of the Prophet waved over the
whole tract west of Zagros, from Nineveh almost to Susa, or from the
Kurnib to the Kuran river.
</p>
<p>
Another short pause in the Arabian aggressions upon Persia now occurred;
but in the year A.D. 639 their attacks were resumed, and the Persians
had to submit to further losses. Otba, governor of Busrah, sent an
expedition across the Shat-el-Arab into. Susiana, and, supported by
the Arab population of the province, which deserted the Persian side,
engaged Horrmuzan, the satrap, in two battles, defeated him, and forced
him to cede a portion of his territory, including the important city of
Ahwaz. Soon afterwards, Ala, governor of Bahrein, conducted in person an
expedition into Persia Proper, crossing the Gulf in the rude vessels of
the time, and attacking Shehrek, the Persian satrap, who acknowledged
the authority of Isdigerd. Here, the Arabs were for once unsuccessful.
Shehrek collected a force which Ala was afraid to encounter; the Arab
chief retreated to the coast, but found his fleet engulfed by the waves;
and it was only with great difficulty that he made his escape by land
from the country which he had ventured to invade. He owed his escape
to Otba, who sent troops from Busrah to his aid, defeated Shehrek, and
rescued his fellow governor from the peril which threatened, him.
</p>
<p>
In the next year (A.D. 640) Hormuzan, incited by Isdigerd, made a
desperate attempt to recover the territory which he had been compelled
to cede. Assisted by Shehrek, governor of Persia Proper, he attacked the
Arabs unawares, but was speedily met, driven from Ram-Hormuz to Shuster,
and there besieged for the space of six months. As many as eighty
engagements are said to have taken place before the walls, with no
decided advantage to either side. At length Al-Bera, son of Malik, one
of the companions of the Prophet, and believed by many to possess the
prophetic spirit, announced that victory was about to incline to the
Moslems, but that he himself would be slain. A chance arrow having
fulfilled one-half of the prediction, the Arabs felt an assurance that
the other half would follow, and fought with such fanatic ardor that
their expectations were soon fulfilled. The town was won; but Hormuzan
retired into the citadel, and there successfully maintained himself,
till Abu-Sabra, the Mohammedan general, consented to spare his life, and
send him to Medina, where his fate should be determined by the Caliph.
Hormuzan, on obtaining an audience, pretended thirst and asked for a cup
of water, which was given him: he then looked suspiciously around, as
if he expected to be stabbed while drinking. "Fear nothing," said Omar;
"your life is safe till you have drunk the water." The crafty Persian
flung the cup to the ground, and Omar felt that he had been outwitted,
but that he must keep his word. Hormuzan became an Arab pensionary, and
shortly afterwards embraced Islamism. His territories were occupied by
the Moslems, whose dominions were thereby extended from the Kuran to the
Tab river.
</p>
<p>
The Arab conquests on the side of Persia had hitherto been effected
and maintained by the presiding genius of one of the ablest of the
Mohammedan commanders, the victor of Kadi-siyeh, Sa'ad Ibn Abi Wakas.
From Kufa, where he built himself a magnificent palace, which Omar
however caused to be destroyed, this great general and skilful
administrator directed the movements of armies, arranged the divisions
of provinces, apportioned the sums to be paid to the revenue, dealt
out justice, and generally superintended affairs throughout the entire
region conquered by the Arabs to the east of the desert. A man in such
a position necessarily made himself enemies; and complaints were
frequently carried to Omar of his lieutenant's pride, luxury, and
injustice. What foundation there may have been for these charges is
uncertain; but it seems that Omar was persuaded, towards the close of
A.D. 640, or very early in A.D. 641, that they were of sufficient weight
to make it necessary that they should be investigated. He accordingly
recalled Sa'ad from his government to Medina, and replaced him at Kufa
by Ammar Ibn Yaser.
</p>
<p>
The news of this change was carried to Isdigerd at Rei, and caused him
to conceive hopes of recovering his lost territory. The event shows that
he attributed too much to the personal ability of his great antagonist;
but the mistake was not unnatural; and it was a noble impulse which
led him to seize the first promising occasion, in order to renew the
struggle and make a last desperate effort to save his empire and repulse
the barbarous nomads. The facts are not as the Arabian historians
represent them. There was no intention on the part of the Mohammedans to
be content with the conquests which they made, or to remain within the
boundary line of the mountains that separate the Mesopotaraian region
from the high plateau of Iran. Mohammedanism had an insatiable ambition,
and was certain to spread itself in all directions until its forces
were expended, or a bound was set to it by resistance which it could not
overcome. Isdigerd, by remaining quiet, might perhaps have prolonged the
precarious existence of Persia for half a dozen years, though even this
is uncertain, and it is perhaps as probable that the tide of conquest
would have flowed eastward in A.D. 641 or 642, even had he attempted
nothing. What alone we can be sure of his, that no acquiescence on his
part, no abstention from warlike enterprise, no submission short of the
acceptance of Islamism, would have availed to save his country for more
than a very brief space from the tramp of the hordes that were bent on
enriching themselves with the plunder of the whole civilized world,
and imposing on all the nations of the earth their dominion and their
religion.
</p>
<p>
From the citadel of Rei, Isdigerd, in A.D. 641, sounded the call to
battle with no uncertain note. His envoys spread themselves through
Media, Azerbijan, Khorassan, Gurgan, Tabaristan, Merv, Bactria, Seistan,
Kerman, and Farsistan (or Persia Proper), demanding contingents of
troops, and appointing, as the place of rendezvous, the small town of
Nehavend, which is in the mountain region, about fifty miles south of
Hamadan. The call was responded to with zeal; and in a short time
there was gathered together at the place named an army of 150,000 men.
Firuzan, one of the nobles who had commanded at Kadisiyeh, was made
general-in-chief. The design was entertained of descending on Holwan,
and thence upon the lowland region, of re-taking Ctesiphon, crossing the
great rivers, and destroying the rising cities of Kufa and Busrah. But
the Arabs were upon the alert, and anticipated the intended invasion.
Noman, son of Mokarrin, who commanded at Ahwaz, was hastily commissioned
by Omar to collect the Arab troops stationed in Irak, Khuzistan, and
the Sawad, to put himself at their head, and to prevent the outbreak by
marching at once on Nehavend. He succeeded in uniting under his standard
about 30,000 soldiers, and with this moderate force entered the mountain
tract, passed Holwan and Merj, and encamped at Tur, where he expected
the attack of the enemy. But Firuzan had now resolved to maintain the
defensive. He had entrenched himself strongly in front of Nehavend
and was bent on wearing out the patience of the Arabs by a prolonged
resistance. Noman, finding himself unmolested, advanced from Tur to
the immediate neighborhood of Nehavend, and endeavored to provoke his
adversary to give battle, but without effect. For two months the two
hosts faced each other without fighting. At last, the stores of the
Arabs, as well as their patience, began to fail; and it was necessary to
employ some device, or to give up the war altogether. Hereupon, Noman,
by the advice of two of his captains, had recourse to a stratagem. He
spread a report that Omar was dead, and breaking up from from his
camp began a hasty retreat. The plan succeeded. Firuzan quitted his
entrenchments, and led his army on the traces of the flying foe. It was
two days before he reached them, and on the third day the battle began.
Noman, having addressed his soldiers and made arrangements concerning
the command in case of his own death, mounted a milk-white steed, and
gave the signal for the fight by thrice shouting the famous tehbir,
or battle-cry, "<i>Allah akbar</i>." The Arabs charged with fury, and for a
while, amid the clouds of dust which rose beneath their feet, nothing
was heard but the clash of steel. At length the Persians gave way; but,
as Noman advanced his standard and led the pursuit, a volley of
arrows from the flying foe checked his movement, and at the same time
terminated his career. A shaft had struck him in a vital part, and he
fell at the moment of victory. For his men, maddened by the loss of
their commander, pressed on more furiously than before; the Persians
were unable to rally; and a promiscuous flight began. Then followed a
dreadful slaughter. The numbers of the Persians must have impeded
their retreat; and in the defiles of the mountains a rapid flight was
impossible. Firuzan himself, who, instead of falling back on Nehavend,
took the road leading north to Hamadan, was overtaken by El Kakaa in a
narrow pass, and put to the sword. More than 100,000 Persians are
said to have perished.128 The victors, pressing onwards, easily took
Nehavend. Hamadan surrendered to them shortly afterwards.120
</p>
<p>
The defeat of Nehavend terminated the Sassanian power. Isdigerd indeed,
escaping from Rei, and flying continually from place to place, prolonged
an inglorious existence for the space of ten more years&mdash;from A.D. 641
to A.D. 651; but he had no longer a kingdom. Persia fell to pieces on
the occasion of "the victory of victories," and made no other united
effort against the Arabs. Province after province was occupied by the
fierce invaders; and, at length, in A.D. 651, their arms penetrated
to Merv, where the last scion of the house of Babek had for some years
found a refuge. It is said that during this interval he had made efforts
to engage the Khan of the Turks and the Emperor of the Chinese to
embrace his cause; but, if this were so, it was without success. Though
they may have lent him some encouragement, no real effort was made by
either potentate on his behalf. Isdigerd, at Merv, during his later
years, experienced the usual fate of sovereigns who have lost their
kingdoms. He was alternately flattered and coerced by pretended friends
among his own people&mdash;induced to cherish vain hopes, and driven to
despair, by the fluctuating counsels of the monarchs of neighboring
nations. At last he was murdered by a subject for the sake of his
clothes, when he was flying from a combined attack of treacherous
subjects and offended foreigners.
</p>
<p>
It is difficult to form a decided opinion as to the character of
Isdigerd III. He was but fifteen years of age at his accession,
twenty-four at the time of the battle of Nehavend, and thirty-four at
his decease, A.D. 651. It is in his favor that "history lays no crimes
to his charge;" for this can be said of very few Sassanian sovereigns.
It is also to his credit that he persevered so long in struggling
against his fate, and in endeavoring to maintain, or restore, the
independence of his nation. But, on the other hand, it must be confessed
that there is little to be admired in the measures which he took to meet
the perils of the time, and that personally he appears to have been weak
and of luxurious habits. During the whole of his long struggle with
the Arabs he seems never once to have placed himself at the head of his
troops, much less to have crossed swords with the enemy. He intrusted
the defence of Persia to generals, and did not even seek to inspire
his soldiers with enthusiasm by his own presence in their camp. Always
occupying some secure fortress far in the rear of his army, he fled from
each as the enemy made a step in advance, quitting Ctesiphon for Holwan,
Holwan for Rei, and Rei for Merv, never venturing upon a stand, never
making an appeal to the loyalty which was amongst the best qualities of
the Persians, and which would have caused them to fight with desperation
in defence of a present king. Carrying with him in all his wanderings
the miserable pageant of an Oriental court, he suffered his movements
to be hampered and his resources crippled by a throng of 4000 useless
retainers, whom he could not bring himself to dismiss. Instead of
donning the armor which befitted one who was struggling for his crown,
he wore to the last the silken robes, the jewelled belt, the rings and
bracelets that were only suited for the quiet inmate of a palace, and by
this incongruous and misplaced splendor he provoked, and, perhaps we may
say, deserved his fate. A monarch who loses his crown for the most
part awakens interest and sympathy; but no historian has a word of
commiseration for the last of the Sassanidae, who is reproached with
feebleness, cowardice, and effeminacy. It must certainly be allowed that
he was no hero; but considering his extreme youth when his perils began,
the efforts which he made to meet them, and the impossibility of an
effective resistance in the effete and exhausted condition of the
Persian nation, history is scarcely justified in passing upon the
unfortunate prince a severe judgment.
</p>
<p>
The coins assigned to Isdigerd III. are neither numerous nor very
remarkable. The head is in general very similar to that of Artaxerxes
III. The pearl bordering around it is single, and in the margin are
the usual stars and crescents of the later Sassanian kings. The margin,
however, shows also in some instances a peculiar device behind the
crown, and also a legend, which has been read, but very doubtfully,
as "Ormazd." The king's name is given as Iskart or Iskarti. Among
the regnal years marked on the reverse have been found the numbers
"nineteen" and "twenty." Among the mint-marks are Azer-bijan, Abiverd,
and Merv. <a href="#image-0005">[PLATE XXIV., Fig. 4]</a>

<p>
"With the accession of the Sassanians, Persia regained much of that
power and stability to which she had been so long a stranger....
The improvement in the fine arts at home indicates returning
prosperity, and a degree of security unknown since the fall of the
Achaemenidae."&mdash;Fergusson, <i>History of Architecture</i>, vol. i. pp. 381-3,
3d edition.
</p>
<p>
When Persia under the Sassanian princes shook off the barbarous yoke
to which she had submitted for the space of almost five centuries, she
found architecture and the other fine arts at almost the lowest possible
ebb throughout the greater part of Western Asia. The ruins of the
Achaemenian edifices, which were still to be seen at Pasargadae,
Persopolis, and elsewhere, bore witness to the grandeur of idea, and
magnificence of construction, which had once formed part of the heritage
of the Persian nation; but the intervening period was one during which
the arts had well-nigh wholly disappeared from the Western Asiatic
world; and when the early sovereigns of the house of Sassan felt the
desire, common with powerful monarchs, to exhibit their greatness in
their buildings, they found themselves at the first without artists
to design, without artisans to construct, and almost without models to
copy. The Parthians, who had ruled over Persia for nearly four hundred
years,' had preferred country to city life, tents to buildings, and had
not themselves erected a single edifice of any pretension during the
entire period of their dominion. Nor had the nations subjected to their
sway, for the most part, exhibited any constructive genius, or been
successful in supplying the artistic deficiencies of their rulers. In
one place alone was there an exception to this general paralysis of the
artistic powers. At Hatra, in the middle Mesopotamian region, an Arab
dynasty, which held under the Parthian kings, had thought its dignity
to require that it should be lodged in a palace, and had resuscitated a
native architecture in Mesopotamia, after centuries of complete neglect.
When the Sassanians looked about for a foundation on which they might
work, and out of which they might form a style suitable to their needs
and worthy of their power and opulence, they found what they sought in
the Hatra edifice, which was within the limits of their kingdom, and at
no great distance from one of the cities where they held their Court.
</p>
<p>
The early palaces of the Sassanians have ceased to exist. Artaxerxes,
the son of Babek, Sapor the first, and their immediate successors,
undoubtedly erected residences for themselves exceeding in size and
richness the buildings which had contented the Parthians, as well as
those in which their own ancestors, the tributary kings of Persia under
Parthia, had passed their lives. But these residences have almost wholly
disappeared. The most ancient of the Sassanian buildings which admit of
being measured and described are assigned to the century between A.D.
350 and 450; and we are thus unable to trace the exact steps by which
the Sassanian style was gradually elaborated. We come upon it when it is
beyond the stage of infancy, when it has acquired a marked and decided
character, when it no longer hesitates or falters, but knows what it
wants, and goes straight to its ends. Its main features are simple,
and are uniform from first to last, the later buildings being merely
enlargements of the earlier, by an addition to the number or to the size
of the apartments. The principal peculiarities of the style are, first,
that the plan of the entire building is an oblong square, without
adjuncts or projections; secondly, that the main entrance is into a
lofty vaulted porch or hall by an archway of the entire width of
the apartment; thirdly, that beside these oblong halls, the building
contains square apartments, vaulted with domes, which are circular
at their base, and elliptical in their section, and which rest on
pendentives of an unusual character; fourthly, that the apartments
are numerous and en suite, opening one into another, without the
intervention of passages; and fifthly, that the palace comprises, as a
matter of course, a court, placed towards the rear of the building, with
apartments opening into it.
</p>
<p>
The oblong square is variously proportioned. The depth may be a little
more than the breadth, or it may be nearly twice as much. In either
case, the front occupies one of the shorter sides, or ends of the
edifice. The outer wall is sometimes pierced by one entrance only;
but, more commonly, entrances are multiplied beyond the limit commonly
observed in modern buildings. The great entrance is in the exact centre
of the front. This entrance, as already noticed, is commonly by a lofty
arch which (if we set aside the domes) is of almost the full height of
the building, and constitutes one of its most striking, and to Europeans
most extraordinary, features. From the outer air, we look; as it were,
straight into the heart of the edifice, in one instance to the depth
of 115 feet, a distance equal to the length of Henry VII.'s Chapel
at Westminster. The effect is very strange when first seen by the
inexperienced traveller; but similar entrances are common in the mosques
of Armenia and Persia, and in the palaces of the latter country. In the
mosques "lofty and deeply-recessed portals," "unrivalled for grandeur
and appropriateness," are rather the rule than the exception; and, in
the palaces, "Throne-rooms" are commonly mere deep recesses of this
character, vaulted or supported by pillars, and open at one end to the
full width and height of the apartment. The height of the arch varies
in Sassanian buildings from about fifty to eighty-five feet; it is
generally plain, and without ornament; but in one case we meet with a
foiling of small arches round the great one, which has an effect that is
not unpleasing.
</p>
<p>
The domed apartments are squares of from twenty-five to forty feet, or a
little more. The domes are circular at their base; but a section of them
would exhibit a half ellipse, with its longest and shortest diameters
proportioned as three to two. The height to which they rise from the
ground is not much above seventy feet. A single building will have two
or three domes, either of the same size, or occasionally of different
dimensions. It is a peculiarity of their construction that they rest,
not on drums, but on pendentives of a curious character. A series of
semi-circular arches is thrown across the angles of the apartment,
each projecting further into it than the preceding, and in this way
the corners are got rid of, and the square converted into the circular
shape. A cornice ran round the apartment, either above or below the
pendentives, or sometimes both above and below. The domes were pierced
by a number of small holes, which admitted some light, and the upper
part of the walls between the pendentives was also pierced by windows.
</p>
<p>
There are no passages or corridors in the Sassanian palaces. The rooms
for the most part open one into the other. Where this is not the case,
they give upon a common meeting-ground, which is either an open court,
or a large vaulted apartment. The openings are in general doorways of
moderate size, but sometimes they are arches of the full width of the
subordinate room or apartment. As many as seventeen or eighteen rooms
have been found in a palace.
</p>
<p>
There is no appearance in any Sassanian edifice of a real second story.
The famous Takht-i-Khosru presents externally the semblance of such an
arrangement; but this seems to have been a mere feature of the external
ornamentation, and to have had nothing to do with the interior.
</p>
<p>
The exterior ornamentation of the Sassanian buildings was by pilasters,
by arched recesses, by cornices, and sometimes by string-courses. An
ornamentation at once simple and elegant is that of the lateral faces of
the palace at Firuzabad, where long reed-like pilasters are carried
from the ground to the cornice, while between them are a series of tall
narrow doubly recessed arches. Far less satisfactory is the much more
elaborate design adopted at Ctesiphon, where six series of blind
arches of different kinds are superimposed the one on the other, with
string-courses between them, and with pilasters, placed singly or
in pairs, separating the arches into groups, and not regularly
superimposed, as pillars, whether real or seeming, ought to be.
</p>
<p>
The interior ornamentation was probably, in a great measure, by stucco,
painting, and perhaps gilding. All this, however, if it existed, has
disappeared; and the interiors now present a bare and naked appearance,
which is only slightly relieved by the occasional occurrence of windows,
of ornamental doorways, and of niches, which recall well-known features
at Persepolis. In some instances, however, the arrangement of the larger
rooms was improved by means of short pillars, placed at some distance
from the walls, and supporting a sort of transverse rib, which broke the
uniformity of the roof. The pillars were connected with the side walls
by low arches.
</p>
<p>
Such are the main peculiarities of Sassanian palace architecture. The
general effect of the great halls is grand, though scarcely beautiful;
and, in the best specimens, the entire palace has an air of simple
severity which is striking and dignified. The internal arrangements do
not appear to be very convenient. Too much is sacrificed to regularity;
and the opening of each room into its neighbor must, one would
think, have been unsatisfactory. Still, the edifices are regarded as
"indicating considerable originality and power," though they "point to a
state of society when attention to security hardly allowed the architect
the free exercise of the more delicate ornaments of his art."
</p>
<p>
From this general account of the main features of the architecture it
is proposed now to proceed to a more particular description of the
principal extant Sassanian buildings&mdash;the palaces at Serbistan,
Firuzabad, Ctesiphon, and Mashita.
</p>
<p>
The palace at Serbistan is the smallest, and probably the earliest of
the four. It has been assigned conjecturally to the middle of the fourth
century, or the reign of Sapor II. The ground plan is an oblong but
little removed from a square, the length being 42 French metres, and the
breadth nearly 37 metres. <a href="#image-0006">[PLATE XXV., Fig. 1.]</a> The building faces west,
and is entered by three archways, between which are groups of three
semi-circular pilasters, while beyond the two outer arches towards the
angles of the building is a single similar pilaster. Within the archways
are halls or porches of different depths, the central one of the three
being the shallowest. <a href="#image-0006">[PLATE XXV., Fig. 2.]</a> This opens by an arched
doorway into a square chamber, the largest in the edifice. It is domed,
and has a diameter of about 42 feet or, including recesses, of above 57
feet. The interior height of the dome from the floor is 65 feet. Beyond
the domed chamber is a court, which measures 45 feet by 40, and has
rooms of various sizes opening into it. One of these is domed; and
others are for the most part vaulted. The great domed chamber opens
towards the north, on a deep porch or hall, which was entered from
without by the usual arched portal. On the south it communicates with a
pillared hall, above 60 feet long by 30 broad. There is another somewhat
similar hall on the north side of the building, in width about equal,
but in length not quite 50 feet. In both halls the pillars are short,
not exceeding six feet. They support piers, which run up perpendicularly
for a considerable height, and then become ribs of the vaulting.

</center>

<p>
The Firuzabad palace has a length of above 390 and a width of above
180 feet. Its supposed date is A.D. 450, or the reign of Isdigerd I.
As usual the ground plan is an oblong square. <a href="#image-0007">[PLATE XXVI.]</a> It is
remarkable that the entire building had but a single entrance. This was
by a noble arch, above 50 feet in height, which faced north, and gave
admission into a vaulted hall, nearly 90 feet long by 43 wide, having at
either side two lesser halls of a similar character, opening into it
by somewhat low semi-circular arches, of nearly the full width of the
apartments. Beyond these rooms, and communicating with them by narrow,
but elegant doorways, were three domed chambers precisely similar,
occupying together the full width of the building, each about 43 feet
square, and crowned by elliptical domes rising to the height of nearly
70 feet. <a href="#image-0008">[PLATE XXVII., Fig. 1.]</a> The ornamentation of these chambers was
by their doorways, and by false windows, on the Persepolitan model. The
domed chambers opened into some small apartments, beyond which was
a large court, about 90 feet square, surrounded by vaulted rooms of
various sizes, which for the most part communicated directly with it.
False windows, or recesses, relieved the interior of these apartments,
but were of a less elaborate character than those of the domed chambers.
Externally the whole building was chastely and tastefully ornamented by
the tall narrow arches and reed-like pilasters already mentioned. <a href="#image-0008">[PLATE
XXVII., Fig. 2.]</a> Its character, however, was upon the whole "simple and
severe;" nor can we quarrel with the judgment which pronounces it "more
like a gigantic bastile than the palace of a gay, pavilion-loving people
like the Persians."

<p>
It is difficult to form any very decided opinion upon the architectural
merits of the third and grandest of the Sassanian palaces, the well
known "Takht-i-Ehosru," or palace of Chosroe's Anushirwan, at Ctesiphon.
What remains of this massive erection is a mere fragment, which, to
judge from the other extant Sassanian ruins, cannot have formed so much
as one fourth part of the original edifice. <a href="#image-0009">[PLATE XXVIII., Fig. 1.]</a>
Nothing has come down to our day but a single vaulted hall on the
grandest scale, 72 feet wide, 85 high, and 115 deep, together with the
mere outer wall of what no doubt constituted the main facade of the
building. The apartments, which, according to all analogy, must have
existed at the two sides, and in the rear, of the great hall, some of
which should have been vaulted, have wholly perished. Imagination may
supply them from the Firuzabad, or the Mashita palace; but not a trace,
even of their foundations, is extant; and the details, consequently, are
uncertain, though the general plan can scarcely be doubted. At each side
of the great hall were probably two lateral ones, communicating with
each other, and capable of being entered either from the hall or from
the outer air. Beyond the great hall was probably a domed chamber,
equalling it in width, and opening upon a court, round which were a
number of moderate-sized apartments. The entire building was no doubt
an oblong square, of which the shorter sides seem to have measured 370
feet. It had at least three, and may not improbably have had a larger
number of entrances, since it belongs to tranquil times and a secure
locality.
</p>
<a name="image-0009"><!--IMG--></a>
<center>
<img src="images/plate028.jpg" height="969" width="574"
alt="Plate Xxviii. 
">
</center>

<p>
The ornamentation of the existing facade of the palace is by doorways,
doubly-arched recesses, pilasters, and string-courses. These last divide
the building, externally, into an appearance of three or four distinct
stories. The first and second stories are broken into portions by
pilasters, which in the first or basement stories are in pairs, but
in the second stand singly. It is remarkable that the pilasters of the
second story are not arranged with any regard to those of the first,
and are consequently in many cases not superimposed upon the lower
pilasters. In the third and fourth stories there are no pilasters, the
arched recesses being here continued without any interruption. Over
the great arch of the central hall, a foiling of seventeen small
semicircular arches constitutes a pleasing and unusual feature.
</p>
<p>
The Mashita palace, which was almost certainly built between A.D. 614
and A.D. 627, while on a smaller scale than that of Ctesiphon, was far
more richly ornamented. <a href="#image-0009">[PLATE XXVIII., Fig. 2.]</a> This construction of
Chosroes II. (Parwiz) consisted of two distinct, buildings (separated by
a court-yard, in which was a fountain), extending each of them about 180
feet along the front, with a depth respectively of 140 and 150 feet. The
main building, which lay to the north, was entered from the courtyard by
three archways, semicircular and standing side by side, separated only
by columns of hard, white stone, of a quality approaching to marble.
These columns were surmounted by debased Corinthian capitals, of a type
introduced by Justinian, and supported arches which were very richly
fluted, and which are said to have been "not unlike our own late Norman
work." <a href="#image-0010">[PLATE XXIX., Fig. 2.]</a> The archways gave entrance into an oblong
court or hall, about 80 feet long, by sixty feet wide, on which opened
by a wide doorway the main room of the building. This was a triapsal
hall, built of brick, and surmounted by a massive domed roof of the same
material, which rested on pendentives like those employed at Serbistan
and at Firuzabad. The diameter of the hall was a little short of 60
feet. On either side of the triapsal hall, and in its rear, and again
on either side of the court or hall on which it opened, were rooms of
a smaller size, generally opening into each other, and arranged
symmetrically, each side being the exact counterpart of the other. The
number of these smaller apartments was twenty-five. [PLATE XXIX., Fig.
1.]

<p>
The other building, which lies towards the south, and is separated from
the one just described by the whole length of the court-yard, a distance
of nearly 200 feet, appears to have been for the most part of an
inferior character. It comprised one large hall, or inner court, but
otherwise contained only small apartments, which, it is thought, may
have been "intended as guard-rooms for the soldiers." Although, however,
in most respects so unpretending, this edifice was adorned externally
with a richness and magnificence unparalleled in the other remains of
Sassanian times, and scarcely exceeded in the architecture of any age or
nation. Forming, as it did, the only entrance by which the palace could
be approached, and possessing the only front which was presented to
the gaze of the outer world, its ornamentation was clearly an object of
Chosroes' special care, who seems to have lavished upon it all the known
resources of art. The outer wall was built of finely-dressed hard
stone; and on this excellent material the sculptors of the time&mdash;whether
Persian or Byzantine, it is impossible to determine&mdash;proceeded to carve
in the most elaborate way, first a bold pattern of zigzags and rosettes,
and then, over the entire surface, a most delicate tracery of foliage,
animals, and fruits. The effect of the zigzags is to divide the wall
into a number of triangular compartments, each of which is treated
separately, covered with a decoration peculiar to itself, a fretwork of
the richest kind, in which animal and vegetable forms are most happily
intermingled. In one a vase of an elegant shape stands midway in the
triangle at its base; two doves are seated on it, back to back; from
between them rises a vine, which spreads its luxuriant branches over the
entire compartment, covering it with its graceful curves and abundant
fruitage; on either side of the vase a lion and a wild boar confront the
doves with a friendly air; while everywhere amid the leaves and grapes
we see the forms of birds, half revealed, half hidden by the foliage.
Among the birds, peacocks, parrots, and partridges have been recognized;
among the beasts, besides lions and wild boars, buffaloes, panthers,
lynxes, and gazelles. In another panel a winged lion, the "lineal
descendant of those found at Nineveh and Persepolis," reflects the
mythological symbolism of Assyria, and shows how tenacious was its hold
on the West-Asian mind. Nor is the human form wholly wanting. In one
place we perceive a man's head, in close juxtaposition with man's
inseparable companion, the dog; in another, the entire figure of a man,
who carries a basket of fruit.
</p>
<p>
Besides the compartments within the zigzags, the zigzags themselves and
the rosettes are ornamented with a patterning of large leaves, while the
moulding below the zigzags and the cornice, or string-course, above
them are covered with conventional designs, the interstices between
them being filled in with very beautiful adaptations of lesser vegetable
forms.
</p>
<p>
Altogether, the ornamentation of this magnificent facade may be
pronounced almost unrivalled for beauty and appropriateness; and
the entire palace may well be called "a marvellous example of the
sumptuousness and selfishness of ancient princes," who expended on the
gratification of their own taste and love of display the riches which
would have been better employed in the defence of their kingdoms, or in
the relief of their poorer subjects.
</p>
<p>
The exquisite ornamentation of the Mashita palace exceeds anything which
is found elsewhere in the Sassanian buildings, but it is not wholly
different in kind from that of other remains of their architecture
in Media and Persia Proper. The archivolte which adorns the arch of
Takht-i-Bostan <a href="#image-0012">[PLATE XXXI., Fig. 1.]</a> possesses almost equal delicacy
with the patterned cornice or string-course of the Mashita building; and
its flowered panels may compare for beauty with the Mashita triangular
compartments. <a href="#image-0012">[PLATE XXXI., Fig. 2.]</a> Sassanian capitals are also in
many instances of lovely design, sometimes delicately diapered (A,
B), sometimes worked with a pattern of conventional leaves and flowers
<a href="#image-0013">[PLATE XXXII.]</a>, occasionally exhibiting the human form (D, E), or a
flowery patterning, like that of the Takht-i-Bostan (F, Q). <a href="#image-0014">[PLATE
XXXIII.]</a> In the more elaborate specimens, the four faces&mdash;for the
capitals are square&mdash;present designs completely different; in other
instances, two of the four faces are alike, but on the other two the
design is varied. The shafts of Sassanian columns, so far as we can
judge, appear to have been fluted.

A work not exactly architectural, yet possessing architectural
features&mdash;the well-known arch of Chosroes II. above alluded to&mdash;seems
to deserve description before we pass to another branch of our subject.
<a href="#image-0015">[PLATE XXXIV., Fig. 1.]</a> This is an archway or grotto cut in the rock
at Takht-i-Bostan, near Kerman-shah, which is extremely curious and
interesting. On the brink of a pool of clear water, the sloping face
of the rock has been cut into, and a recess formed, presenting at its
further end a perpendicular face. This face, which is about 34 feet
broad, by 31 feet high, and which is ornamented at the top by some
rather rude gradines, has been penetrated by an arch, cut into the solid
stone to the depth of above 20 feet, and elaborately ornamented,
both within and without. Externally, the arch is in the first place
surmounted by the archivolte already spoken of, and then, in the
spandrels on either side are introduced flying figures of angels or
Victories, holding chaplets in one hand and cups or vases in the other,
which are little inferior to the best Roman art. <a href="#image-0015">[PLATE XXXIV., Fig. 2.]</a>
Between the figures is a crescent, perhaps originally enclosing a ball,
and thus presenting to the spectator, at the culminating point of the
whole sculpture, the familiar emblems of two of the national divinities.
Below the spandrels and archivolte, on either side of the arched
entrance, are the flowered panels above-mentioned, alike in most
respects, but varying in some of their details. Within the recess, its
two sides, and its further end, are decorated with bas-reliefs, those
on the sides representing Chosroes engaged in the chase of the wild boar
and the stag, while those at the end, which are in two lines, one over
the other, show the monarch, above, in his robes of state, receiving
wreaths from ideal beings; below, in his war costume, mounted upon his
favorite charger, Sheb-Diz, with his spear poised in his hand, awaiting
the approach of the enemy. The modern critic regards this figure as
"original and interesting." We shall have occasion to recur to it when
we treat of the "Manners and Customs" of the Neo-Persian people.

The glyptic art of the Sassanian is seen chiefly in their bas-reliefs;
but one figure "in the round" has come down to us from their times,
which seems to deserve particular description. This is a colossal statue
of Sapor I., hewn (it would seem) out of the natural rock, which still
exists, though overthrown and mutilated, in a natural grotto near the
ruined city of Shapur. <a href="#image-0016">[PLATE XXXV.]</a> The original height of the figure,
according to M. Texier, was 6 metres 7 centimetres, or between 19 and.
20 feet. It was well proportioned, and carefully wrought, representing
the monarch in peaceful attire, but with a long sword at his left side,
wearing the mural crown which characterizes him on the bas-reliefs,
and dressed in a tunic and trousers of a light and flexible material,
apparently either silk or muslin. The hair, beard, and mustachios,
were neatly arranged and well rendered. The attitude of the figure was
natural and good. One hand, the right, rested upon the hip; the other
touched, but without grasping it, the hilt of the long straight sword.
If we may trust the representation of M. Texier's artist, the folds of
the drapery were represented with much skill and delicacy; but the hands
and feet of the figure, especially the latter, were somewhat roughly
rendered.

<p>
The bas-reliefs of the Sassanians are extremely numerous, and though
generally rude, and sometimes even grotesque, are not without a certain
amount of merit. Some of the earlier and coarser specimens have been
already given in this volume; and one more of the same class is here
appended <a href="#image-0017">[PLATE XXXVI., Fig. 1.]</a> but we have now to notice some other
and better examples, which seem to indicate that the Persians of this
period attained a considerable proficiency in this branch of the glyptic
art. The reliefs belonging to the time of Sapor I. are generally poor
in conception and ill-executed; but in one instance, unless the modern
artist has greatly flattered his original, a work of this time is not
devoid of some artistic excellence. This is a representation of the
triumph of Sapor over Valerian, comprising only four figures&mdash;Sapor,
an attendant, and two Romans&mdash;of which the three principal are boldly
drawn, in attitudes natural, yet effective, and in good proportion.
<a href="#image-0018">[PLATE XXXVII.]</a> The horse on which Sapor rides is of the usual clumsy
description, reminding us of those which draw our brewers' wains; and
the exaggerated hair, floating ribbons and uncouth head-dress of the
monarch give an <i>outre</i> and ridiculous air to the chief figure; but, if
we deduct these defects, which are common to almost all the Sassanian
artists, the representation becomes pleasing and dignified. Sapor sits
his horse well, and thinks not of himself, but of what he is doing.
Cyriades, who is somewhat too short, receives the diadem from his
benefactor with a calm satisfaction. But the best figure is that of the
captive emperor, who kneels on one knee, and, with outstretched arms,
implores the mercy of the conqueror. The whole representation is
colossal, the figures being at least three times the size of life; the
execution seems to have been good; but the work has been considerably
injured by the effects of time.

Another bas-relief of the age of Sapor I. is on too large a scale, and
too complicated, to be represented here; but a description may be given
of it, and a specimen subjoined, from which the reader may judge of
its character. On a surface of rock at Shapur, carefully smoothed and
prepared for sculpture, the second Sassanian monarch appears in the
centre of the tablet, mounted on horseback, and in his usual costume,
with a dead Roman under his horse's feet, and holding another
(Cyriades?), by the hand. In front of him, a third Roman, the
representative of the defeated nation, makes submission; and then follow
thirteen tribute-bearers, bringing rings of gold, shawls, bowls, and the
like, and conducting also a horse and an elephant. Behind the monarch,
on the same line, are thirteen mounted guardsmen. Directly above, and
directly below the central group, the tablet is blank; but on either
side the subject is continued, above in two lines, and below in one,
the guardsmen towards the left amounting in all to fifty-six, and the
tribute-bearers on the right to thirty-five. The whole tablet comprises
ninety-five human and sixty-three animal figures, besides a
Victory floating in the sky. The illustration <a href="#image-0019">[PLATE XXXVIII.]</a> is a
representation of the extreme right-hand portion of the second line.

<p>
After the time of Sapor I. there is a manifest decline in Sassanian art.
The reliefs of Varahran II. and Varahran III., of Narses and Sapor III.,
fall considerably below those of Sapor, son of Artaxerxes. It is not
till we arrive at the time of Varahran IV. (A.D. 388-399) that we once
more have works which possess real artistic merit. Indications have
already appeared in an earlier chapter of this monarch's encouragement
of artists, and of a kind of art really meriting the name. We saw
that his gems were exquisitely cut, and embodied designs of first-rate
excellence. It has now to be observed further, that among the
bas-reliefs of the greatest merit which belong to Sassanian times, one
at least must be ascribed to him; and that, this being so, there is
considerable probability that two others of the same class belong also
to his reign. The one which must undoubtedly be his, and which tends
to fix the date of the other two, exists at Nakhsh-i-Kustam, near
Persepolis, and has frequently been copied by travellers. It represents
a mounted warrior, with the peculiar head-dress of Varahran IV.,
charging another at full speed, striking him with his spear, and bearing
both horse and rider to the ground. <a href="#image-0020">[PLATE XXXIX.]</a> A standard-bearer
marches a little behind; and a dead warrior lies underneath Varahran's
horse, which is clearing the obstacle in his bound. The spirit of the
entire composition is admirable; and though the stone is in a state of
advanced decay, travellers never fail to admire the vigor of the design
and the life and movement which characterize it.

The other similar reliefs to which reference has been made exist,
respectively, at Nakhsh-i-Eustam and at Firuzabad. The Nakhsh-i-Rustam
tablet is almost a duplicate of the one above described and represented,
differing from it mainly in the omission of the prostrate figure, in the
forms of the head-dresses borne by the two cavaliers, and in the shape
of the standard. It is also in better preservation than the other,
and presents some additional details. The head-dress of the Sassanian
warrior is very remarkable, being quite unlike any other known example.
It consists of a cap, which spreads as it rises, and breaks into three
points, terminating in large striped balls. <a href="#image-0007">[PLATE XXVI., Fig. 2.]</a>
His adversary wears a helmet crowned with a similar ball. The standard,
which is in the form of a capital T, displays also five balls of the
same sort, three rising from the cross-bar, and the other two hanging
from it. Were it not for the head-dress of the principal figure, this
sculpture might be confidently assigned to the monarch who set up the
neighboring one. As it is, the point must be regarded as undecided, and
the exact date of the relief as doubtful. It is, however, unlikely to be
either much earlier, or much later, than the time of Varahran IV.
</p>
<p>
The third specimen of a Sassanian battle-scene exists at Firuzabad, in
Persia Proper, and has been carefully rendered by M. Flandin. It is in
exceedingly bad condition, but appears to have comprised the figures
of either five or six horsemen, of whom the two principal are a warrior
whose helmet terminates in the head of a bird, and one who wears a
crown, above which rises a cap, surmounted by a ball. <a href="#image-0021">[PLATE XL.]</a> The
former of these, who is undoubtedly a Sassanian prince, pierces with
his spear the right side of the latter, who is represented in the act of
falling to the ground. His horse tumbles at the same time, though why he
does so is not quite clear, since he has not been touched by the other
charger. His attitude is extravagantly absurd, his hind feet being on a
level with the head of his rider. Still more absurd seems to have been
the attitude of a horse at the extreme right, which turns in falling,
and exposes to the spectator the inside of the near thigh and the belly.
But, notwithstanding these drawbacks, the representation has great
merit. The figures live and breathe&mdash;that of the dying king expresses
horror and helplessness, that of his pursuer determined purpose
and manly strength. Even the very horses are alive, and manifestly
rejoice in the strife. The entire work is full of movement, of variety,
and of artistic spirit.

<p>
If we have regard to the highest qualities of glyptic art, Sassanian
sculpture must be said here to culminate. There is a miserable falling
off, when about a hundred and fifty years later the Great Chosroes
(Anushirwan) represents himself at Shapur, seated on his throne, and
fronting to the spectator, with guards and attendants on one side, and
soldiers bringing in prisoners, human heads, and booty, on the other.
<a href="#image-0022">[PLATE XLI.]</a> The style here recalls that of the tamer reliefs set up by
the first Sapor, but is less pleasing. Some of the prisoners appear
to be well drawn; but the central figure, that of the monarch, is
grotesque; the human heads are ghastly; and the soldiers and attendants
have little merit. The animal forms are better&mdash;that of the elephant
especially, though as compared with the men it is strangely out of
proportion.

With Chosroes II. (Eberwiz or Parviz), the grandson of Anushirwan,
who ascended the throne only twelve years after the death of his
grandfather, and reigned from A.D. 591 to A.D. 628, a reaction set in.
We have seen the splendor and good taste of his Mashita palace,
the beauty of some of his coins, and the general excellence of his
ornamentation. It remains to notice the character of his reliefs, found
at present in one locality only, viz., at Takht-i-Bostan, where they
constitute the main decorations of the great triumphal arch of this
monarch. <a href="#image-0023">[PLATE XLII.]</a>

<p>
These reliefs consist of two classes of works, colossal figures and
hunting-pieces. The colossal figures, of which some account has been
already given, and which are represented in PLATE XLI., have but little
merit. They are curious on account of their careful elaboration, and
furnish important information with respect to Sassanian dress and
armature, but they are poor in design, being heavy, awkward, and
ungainly. Nothing can well be less beautiful than the three overstout
personages, who stand with their heads nearly or quite touching the
crown of the arch, at its further extremity, carefully drawn in detail,
but in outline little short of hideous. The least bad is that to the
left, whose drapery is tolerably well arranged, and whose face, judging
by what remains of it, was not unpleasing. Of the other two it is
impossible to say a word in commendation.
</p>
<p>
The mounted cavalier below them&mdash;Chosroes himself on his black war
horse, Sheb-Diz&mdash;is somewhat better. The pose of horse and horseman has
dignity; the general proportions are fairly correct, though (as usual)
the horse is of a breed that recalls the modern dray-horse rather
than the charger. The figure, being near the ground, has suffered much
mutilation, probably at the hands of Moslem fanatics; the off hind
leg of the horse is gone; his nose and mouth have disappeared; and the
horseman has lost his right foot and a portion of his lower clothing.
But nevertheless, the general effect is not altogether destroyed.
Modern travellers admire the repose and dignity of the composition, its
combination of simplicity with detail, and the delicacy and finish of
some portions. It may be added that the relief of the figure is high;
the off legs of the horse were wholly detached; and the remainder of
both horse and rider was nearly, though not quite, disengaged from the
rock behind them.
</p>
<p>
The hunting-pieces, which ornament the interior of the arched recess
on either side, are far superior to the colossal figures, and merit
an exact description. On the right, the perpendicular space below the
spring of the arch contains the representation of a stag hunt, in which
the monarch and about a dozen other mounted horsemen take part, assisted
by some ten or twelve footmen, and by a detachment mounted on elephants.
<a href="#image-0024">[PLATE XLIII.]</a> The elephants, which are nine in number, occupy the
extreme right of the tablet, and seem to be employed in driving the deer
into certain prepared enclosures. Each of the beasts is guided by three
riders, sitting along their backs, of whom the central one alone has the
support of a saddle or howdah. The enclosures into which the elephants
drive the game are three in number; they are surrounded by nets; and
from the central one alone is there an exit. Through this exit, which is
guarded by two footmen, the game passes into the central field, or main
space of the sculpture, where the king awaits them. He is mounted on his
steed, with his bow passed over his head, his sword at his side, and
an attendant holding the royal parasol over him. It is not quite clear
whether he himself does more than witness the chase. The game is in
the main pursued and brought to the ground by horsemen without royal
insignia, and is then passed over into a further compartment&mdash;the
extreme one towards the left, where it is properly arranged and placed
upon camels for conveyance to the royal palace. During the whole
proceeding a band of twenty-six musicians, some of whom occupy an
elevated platform, delights with a "concord of sweet sounds" the
assembled sportsmen.
</p>

<center>
<img src="images/plate043.jpg" height="576" width="971"
alt="Plate Xliii. 
">
</center>

<p>
On the opposite, or left-hand, side of the recess, is represented a
boar-hunt. <a href="#image-0025">[PLATE XLIV.]</a> Here again, elephants, twelve in number, drive
the game into an enclosure without exit. Within this space nearly a
hundred boars and pigs may be counted. The ground being marshy, the
monarch occupies a boat in the centre, and from this transfixes the game
with his arrows. No one else takes part in the sport, unless it be the
riders on a troop of five elephants, represented in the lower middle
portion of the tablet. When the pigs fall, they are carried into
a second enclosure, that on the right, where they are upturned,
disembowelled, and placed across the backs of elephants, which convey
them to the abode of the monarch. Once more, the scene is enlivened by
music. Two bands of harpers occupy boats on either side of that which
carries the king, while another harper sits with him in the boat from
which he delivers his arrows. In the water about the boats are seen
reeds, ducks, and numerous fishes. The oars by which the boats are
propelled have a singular resemblance to those which are represented in
some of the earliest Assyrian sculptures. Two other features must also
be noticed. Near the top of the tablet, towards the left, five figures
standing in a boat seem to be clapping their hands in order to drive the
pigs towards the monarch; while in the right centre of the picture there
is another boat, more highly ornamented than the rest, in which we seem
to have a second representation of the king, differing from the first
only in the fact that his arrow has flown, and that he is in the act of
taking another arrow from an attendant In this second representation the
king's head is surrounded by a nimbus or "glory." Altogether there are
in this tablet more than seventy-five human and nearly 150 animal forms.
In the other, the human forms are about seventy, and the animal ones
about a hundred.

<img src="images/plate044.jpg" height="574" width="969"

</center>

<p>
The merit of the two reliefs above described, which would require to be
engraved on a large scale, in order that justice should be done to them,
consists in the spirit and truth of the animal forms, elephants, camels,
stags, boars, horses, and in the life and movement of the whole picture.
The rush of the pigs, the bounds of the stags and hinds, the heavy
march of the elephants, the ungainly movements of the camels, are well
portrayed; and in one instance, the foreshortening of a horse, advancing
diagonally, is respectably rendered. In general, Sassanian sculpture,
like most delineative art in its infancy, affects merely the profile;
but here, and in the overturned horse already described, and again in
the Victories which ornament the spandrels of the arch of Chosroes, the
mere profile is departed from with good effect, and a power is shown
of drawing human and animal figures in front or at an angle. What is
wanting in the entire Sassanian series is idealism, or the notion
of elevating the representation in any respects above the object
represented; the highest aim of the artist is to be true to nature; in
this truthfulness is his triumph; but as he often falls short of his
models, his whole result, even at the best, is unsatisfactory and
disappointing.
</p>
<p>
Such must almost necessarily be the sentence of art critics, who judge
the productions of this age and nation according to the abstract rules,
or the accepted standards, of artistic effort. But if circumstances of
time and country are taken into account, if comparison is limited to
earlier and later attempts in the same region, or even in neighboring
ones, a very much more favorable judgment will be passed. The Saseanian
reliefs need not on the whole shrink from a comparison with those of
the Achaemenian Persians. If they are ruder and more grotesque, they are
also more spirited and more varied; and thus, though they fall short in
some respects, still they must be pronounced superior to the Achaemenian
in some of the most important artistic qualities. Nor do they fall
greatly behind the earlier, and in many respects admirable, art of the
Assyrians. They are less numerous and cover a lees variety of subjects;
they have less delicacy; but they have equal or greater fire. In the
judgment of a traveller not given to extravagant praise, they are, in
some cases at any rate, "executed in the most masterly style." "I never
saw," observes Sir R. Kerr Porter, "the elephant, the stag, or the boar
portrayed with greater truth and spirit. The attempts at detailed human
form are," he adds, "far inferior."
</p>
<p>
Before, however, we assign to the Sassanian monarchs, and to the people
whom they governed, the merit of having produced results so worthy of
admiration, it becomes necessary to inquire whether there is reason
to believe that other than native artists wore employed in their
production. It has been very confidently stated that Chosroes the Second
"brought Roman artists" to Takht-i-Bostan, and by their aid eclipsed the
glories of his great predecessors, Artaxerxes, son of Babek, and the
two Sapors. Byzantine forms are declared to have been reproduced in the
moldings of the Great Arch, and in the Victories. The lovely tracery
of the Mashita Palace is regarded as in the main the work of Greeks and
Syrians.06 No doubt it is quite possible that there may be some truth in
these allegations; but we must not forget, or let it be forgotten, that
they rest on conjecture and are without historical foundation. The works
of the first Chosroes at Ctesiphon, according to a respectable Greek
writer, were produced for him by foreign artists, sent to his court by
Justinian. But no such statement is made with respect to his grandson.
On the contrary, it is declared by the native writers that a certain
Ferhad, a Persian, was the chief designer of them; and modern critics
admit that his hand may perhaps be traced, not only at Takht-i-Bostan,
but at the Mashita Palace also. If then the merit of the design is
conceded to a native artist, we need not too curiously inquire the
nationality of the workmen employed by him.
</p>
<p>
At the worst, should it be thought that Byzantine influence appears so
plainly in the later Sassanian works, that Rome rather than Persia must
be credited with the buildings and sculptures of both the first and
the second Chosroes, still it will have to be allowed that the
earlier palaces&mdash;those at Ser-bistan and Firuzabad&mdash;and the spirited
battle-scenes above described, are wholly native; since they present
no trace of any foreign element. But, it is in these battle-scenes, as
already noticed, that the delineative art of the Sassanians culminates;
and it may further be questioned whether the Firuzabad palace is not
the finest specimen of their architecture, severe though it be in the
character of its ornamentation; so that, even should we surrender the
whole of the later works enough will still remain to show that the
Sassanians, and the Persians of their day, had merit as artists and
builders, a merit the more creditable to them inasmuch as for five
centuries they had had no opportunity of cultivating their powers,
having been crushed by the domination of a race singularly devoid of
artistic aspirations. Even with regard to the works for which they may
have been indebted to foreigners, it is to be remembered that, unless
the monarchs had appreciated high art, and admired it, they would not
have hired, at great expense, the services of these aliens. For my
own part, I see no reason to doubt that the Sassanian remains of every
period are predominantly, if not exclusively, native, not excepting
those of the first Chosroes, for I mistrust the statement of
Theophylact.

</p>
<p>
The general character of the Persian religion, as revived by the founder
of the Sassanian dynasty, has been described in a former chapter; but
it is felt that the present work would be incomplete if it failed to
furnish the reader with a tolerably full account of so interesting a
matter; more especially, since the religious question lay at the root
of the original rebellion and revolution which raised the Sassanidae
to power, and was to a considerable extent the basis and foundation of
their authority. An access of religious fervor gave the Persians of the
third century after Christ the strength which enabled them to throw
off the yoke of their Parthian lords and recover the sceptre of Western
Asia. A strong&mdash;almost fanatical&mdash;religious spirit animated the greater
number of the Sassanian monarchs. When the end of the kingdom came, the
old faith was still flourishing; and, though its star paled before that
of Mohammedanism, the faith itself survived, and still survives at the
present day.
</p>
<p>
It has been observed that Dualism constituted the most noticeable
feature of the religion. It may now be added that the Dualism professed
was of the most extreme and pronounced kind. Ormazd and Ahriman, the
principles of Good and Evil, were expressly declared to be "twins." They
had "in the beginning come together to create Life and Death, and to
settle how the world was to be." There was no priority of existence
of the one over the other, and no decided superiority. The two, being
coeval, had contended from all eternity, and would, it was almost
certain, continue to contend to all eternity, neither being able to
vanquish the other. Thus an eternal struggle was postulated between good
and evil; and the issue was doubtful, neither side possessing any clear
and manifest advantage.
</p>
<p>
The two principles were Persons. Ormazd was "the creator of life, the
earthly and the spiritual," he who "made the celestial bodies, earth,
water, and trees." He was "good," "holy," "pure," "true," "the Holy
God," "the Holiest," "the Essence of Truth," "the father of all truth,"
"the being best of all," "the master of purity." He was supremely
"happy," being possessed of every blessing, "health, wealth, virtue,
wisdom, immortality." From him came every good gift enjoyed by man; on
the pious and the righteous he bestowed, not only earthly advantages,
but precious spiritual gifts, truth, devotion, "the good mind," and
everlasting happiness; and, as he rewarded the good, so he also
punished the bad, though this was an aspect in which he was but seldom
represented.
</p>
<p>
While Ormazd, thus far, would seem to be a presentation of the Supreme
Being in a form not greatly different from that wherein it has pleased
him to reveal Himself to mankind through the Jewish and Christian
scriptures, there are certain points of deficiency in the
representation, which are rightly viewed as placing the Persian very
considerably below the Jewish and Christian idea. Besides the limitation
on the power and freedom of Ormazd implied in the eternal co-existence
with him of another and a hostile principle, he is also limited by the
independent existence of space, time, and light, which appear in
the Zenda vesta as "self-created," or "without beginning," and must
therefore be regarded as "conditioning" the Supreme Being, who has to
work, as best he may, under circumstances not caused by himself. Again,
Ormazd is not a purely spiritual being. He is conceived of as possessing
a sort of physical nature. The "light," which is one of his properties,
seems to be a material radiance. He can be spoken of as possessing
health. The whole conception of him, though not grossly material, is far
from being wholly immaterial. His nature is complex, not simple. He may
not have a body, in the ordinary sense of the word; but he is entangled
with material accidents, and is far from answering to the pure spirit,
"without body, parts, or passions," which forms the Christian conception
of the Deity.
</p>
<p>
Ahriman, the Evil Principle, is of course far more powerful and terrible
than the Christian and Jewish Satan. He is uncaused, co-eternal with
Ormazd, engaged in a perpetual warfare with him. Whatever good thing
Ormazd creates, Ahriman corrupts and ruins it. Moral and physical evils
are alike at his disposal. He blasts the earth with barrenness, or
makes it produce thorns, thistles, and poisonous plants; his are the
earthquake, the storm, the plague of hail, the thunderbolt; he causes
disease and death, sweeps off a nation's flocks and herds by murrain, or
depopulates a continent by pestilence; ferocious wild beasts, serpents,
toads, mice, hornets, mosquitoes, are his creation; he invented and
introduced into the world the sins of witchcraft, murder, unbelief,
cannibalism, sodomy; he excites wars and tumults, stirs up the bad
against the good, and labors by every possible expedient to make vice
triumph over virtue. Ormazd can exercise no control over him; the utmost
that he can do is to keep a perpetual watch on his rival, and seek to
baffle and defeat him. This he is not always able to do. Despite his
best endeavors, Ahriman is not unfrequently victorious.
</p>
<p>
In the purer times of the Zoroastrian religion it would seem that
neither Ormazd nor Ahriman was represented by sculptured forms. A
symbolism alone was permitted, which none could mistake for a real
attempt to portray these august beings. But by the date of the Sassanian
revival, the original spirit of the religion had suffered considerable
modification; and it was no longer thought impious, or perilous, to
exhibit the heads of the Pantheon, in the forms regarded as appropriate
to them, upon public monuments. The great Artaxerxes, probably soon
after his accession, set up a memorial of his exploits, in which he
represented himself as receiving the insignia of royalty from Ormazd
himself, while Ahriman, prostrate and seemingly, though of course not
really, dead, lay at the feet of the steed on which Ormazd was mounted.
In the form of Ormazd there is nothing very remarkable; he is attired
like the king, has a long beard and flowing locks, and carries in his
left hand a huge staff or baton, which he holds erect in a slanting
position. The figure of Ahriman possesses more interest. The face wears
an expression of pain and suffering; but the features are calm, and in
no way disturbed. They are regular, and at least as handsome as those of
Artaxerxes and his divine patron. He wears a band or diadem across the
brow, above which we see a low cap or crown. From this escape the heads
and necks of a number of vipers or snakes, fit emblems of the poisonous
and "death-dealing" Evil One.
</p>
<p>
Some further representations of Ormazd occur in the Sassanian
sculptures; but Ahriman seems not to be portrayed elsewhere. Ormazd
appears on foot in a relief of the Great Arta-xerxes, which contains two
figures only, those of himself and his divine patron. He is also to be
seen in a sculpture which belongs probably to Sapor I., and represents
that monarch in the act of receiving the diadem from Artaxerxes, his
father. In the former of these two tablets the type exhibited in the
bas-relief just described is followed without any variation; in the
latter, the type is considerably modified. Ormazd still carries his huge
baton, and is attired in royal fashion; but otherwise his appearance is
altogether new and singular. His head bears no crown, but is surrounded
by a halo of streaming rays; he has not much beard, but his hair, bushy
and abundant, flows down on his two shoulders; he faces the spectator,
and holds his baton in both his hands; finally, he stands upon a
blossom, which is thought to be that of a sim-flower. Perhaps the
conjecture is allowable that here we have Ormazd exhibited to us in a
solar character, with the attributes of Mithra, from whom, in the olden
time, he was carefully distinguished.
</p>
<p>
Ormazd seems to have been regarded by the kings as their special
guardian and protector. No other deity (unless in one instance) is
brought into close proximity with them; no other obtains mention in
their inscriptions; from no other do they allow that they receive the
blessing of offspring. Whatever the religion of the common people, that
of the kings would seem to have been, in the main, the worship of this
god, whom they perhaps sometimes confused with Mithra, or associated
with Anaitis, but whom they never neglected, or failed openly to
acknowledge.
</p>
<p>
Under the great Ormazd were a number of subordinate deities, the
principal of whom were Mithra and Serosh, Mithra, the Sun-God, had been
from a very early date an object of adoration in Persia, only second
to Ormazd. The Achaemenian kings joined him occasionally with Ormazd
in their invocations. In processions his chariot, drawn by milk-white
horses, followed closely on that of Ormazd. He was often associated
with Ormazd, as if an equal, though a real equality was probably not
intended. He was "great," "pure," "imperishable," "the beneficent
protector of all creatures," and "the beneficent preserver of all
creatures." He had a thousand ears and ten thousand eyes. His worship
was probably more widely extended than that of Ormazd himself, and was
connected in general with a material representation.
</p>
<p>
In the early times this was a simple disk, or circle; but from the reign
of Artaxerxes Mnemon, a human image seems to have been substituted.
Prayer was offered to Mithra three times a day, at dawn, at noon, and
at sunset; and it was usual to worship him with sacrifice. The horse
appears to have been the victim which he was supposed to prefer.
</p>
<p>
Sraosha, or Serosh, was an angel of great power and dignity. He was the
special messenger of Ormazd, and the head of his celestial army. He was
"tall, well-formed, beautiful, swift, victorious, happy, sincere, true,
the master of truth." It was his office to deliver revelations, to show
men the paths of happiness, and to bring them the blessings which Ormazd
had assigned to each. He invented the music for the five most ancient
Gathas, discovered the barsom or divining-rod, and first taught its use
to mankind. From his palace on the highest summit of the Elburz range,
he watched the proceedings of the evil genii, and guarded the world
from their attempts. The Iranians were his special care; but he lost
no opportunity of injuring the Powers of Darkness, and lessening their
dominion by teaching everywhere the true religion. In the other world
it was his business to conduct the souls of the faithful through the
dangers of the middle passage, and to bring them before the golden
throne of Ormazd.
</p>
<p>
Among minor angelic powers were Vayu, "the wind," who is found also in
the Vedic system; Airyanam, a god presiding over marriages; Vitraha, a
good genius; Tistrya, the Dog Star, etc. The number of the minor
deities was not, however, great; nor do they seem, as in so many other
polytheistic religions, to have advanced in course of time from a
subordinate to a leading position. From first to last they are of small
account; and it seems, therefore, unnecessary to detain the reader by an
elaborate description of them.
</p>
<p>
From the mass, however, of the lower deities or genii must be
distinguished (besides Mithra and Serosh) the six Amesha Spentas, or
Amshashpands, who formed the council of Ormazd, and in a certain sense
reflected his glory. These were Vohu-mano or Bahman, Ashavahista
or Ardibehesht, Khsha-thra-vairya or Shahravar, Spenta-Armaiti or
Isfandarmat, Haurvatat or Khordad, and Ameretat or Amerdat. Vohu-mano,
"the Good Mind," originally a mere attribute of Ormazd, came to be
considered a distinct being, created by him to be his attendant and his
councillor. He was, as it were, the Grand Vizier of the Almighty King,
the chief of the heavenly conclave. Ormazd entrusted to him especially
the care of animal life; and thus, as presiding over cattle, he is the
patron deity of the agriculturist. Asha-vahista, "the best truth," or
"the best purity," is the Light of the universe, subtle, pervading,
omnipresent. He maintains the splendor of the various luminaries, and
presides over the element of fire. Khsha-thra-vairya, "wealth," has the
goods of this world at his disposal, and specially presides over metals,
the conventional signs of wealth; he is sometimes identified with the
metal which he dispenses. Spenta-Armaiti, "Holy Armaiti," is at once
the genius of the Earth, and the goddess of piety. She has the charge of
"the good creation," watches over it, and labors to convert the desolate
and unproductive portions of it into fruitful fields and gardens.
Together with Vohu-mano, she protects the agriculturist, blessing his
land with increase, as Vohu-mano does his cattle. She is called "the
daughter of Ormazd," and is regarded as the agent through whom Ormazd
created the earth. Moreover, "she tells men the everlasting laws, which
no one may abolish," or, in other words, imparts to them the eternal
principles of morality. She is sometimes represented as standing next
to Ormazd in the mythology, as in the profession of faith required of
converts to Zoroastrianism. The two remaining Amshashpands, Haurvatat
and Ameretat, "Health" and "Immortality," have the charge of the
vegetable creation; Haurvatat causes the flow of water, so necessary
to the support of vegetable life in countries where little rain falls;
Ameretat protects orchards and gardens, and enables trees to bring their
fruits to perfection.
</p>
<p>
Another deity, practically perhaps as much worshipped as Ormazd and
Mithra, was Anaitis or Anahit. Anaiitis was originally an Assyrian and
Babylonian, not a Zoroastrian goddess; but her worship spread to the
Persians at a date anterior to Herodotus, and became in a short time
exceedingly popular. It was in connection with this worship that
idolatry seems first to have crept in, Artaxerxes Mnemon (ab. B.C. 400)
having introduced images of Anaitis into Persia, and set them up at
Susa, the capital, at Persepolis, Ecbatana, Bactra, Babylon, Damascus,
and Sardis. Anaitis was the Babylonian Venus; and her rites at Babylon
were undoubtedly of a revolting character. It is to be feared that they
were introduced in all their grossness into Persia, and that this was
the cause of Anahitis great popularity. Her cult "was provided with
priests and hieroduli, and connected with mysteries, feasts, and
unchaste ways."
</p>
<p>
The Persian system was further tainted with idolatry in respect of the
worship of Mithra, and possibly of Vohu-mano (Batman), and of Amerdat;
but on the whole, and especially as compared with other Oriental cults,
the religion, even of the later Zoroastrians, must be regarded as
retaining a non-materialistic and anti-idolatrous character, which
elevated it above other neighboring religions, above Brahminism on the
one hand and Syro-Chaldaean nature-worship on the other.
</p>
<p>
In the kingdom of Darkness, the principal powers, besides Ahriman,
were Ako-mano, Indra, Qaurva, Naonhaitya, Taric, and Zaric. These six
together formed the Council of the Evil One, as the six Amshashpands
formed the council of Ormazd. Ako-mano, "the bad mind," or (literally)
"the naught mind," was set over against Vohu-mano, "the good mind,"
and was Ahriman's Grand Vizier. His special sphere was the mind of man,
where he suggested evil thoughts, and prompted to bad words and wicked
deeds. Indra, identical with the Vedic deity, but made a demon by the
Zoroastrians, presided over storm and tempest, and governed the issues
of war and battle. Qaurva and Naonhaitya were also Vedic deities turned
into devils. It is difficult to assign them any distinct sphere.
Taric and Zaric, "Darkness" and "Poison," had no doubt occupations
corresponding with their names. Besides these chief demons, a countless
host of evil genii (<i>divs</i>) and fairies (<i>pairicas</i>) awaited the orders
and executed the behests of Ahriman.
</p>
<p>
Placed between the two contending worlds of good and evil, man's
position was one of extreme danger and difficulty. Originally set upon
the earth by Ormazd in order to maintain the good creation, he was
liable to the continual temptations and seductions of the divs or devas,
who were "wicked, bad, false, untrue, the originators of mischief, most
baneful, destructive, the basest of all things." A single act of sin
gave them a hold upon him, and each subsequent act increased their
power, until ultimately he became their mere tool and slave. It was
however possible to resist temptation, to cling to the side of right, to
defy and overcome the deltas. Man might maintain his uprightness, walk
in the path of duty, and by the help of the asuras, or "good spirits,"
attain to a blissful paradise.
</p>
<p>
To arrive at this result, man had carefully to observe three principal
duties. These were worship, agriculture, and purity. Worship consisted
in the acknowledgment of the One True God, Ormazd, and of his Holy
Angels, the Amesha Spentas or Amshashpands, in the frequent offering of
prayers, praises, and thanksgivings, in the recitation of set hymns,
the performance of a certain ceremony called the Homa, and in the
occasional sacrifice of animals. The set hymns form a large portion
of the Zendavesta, where they occur in the shape of Gathas, or Yashts,
sometimes possessing considerable beauty. They are sometimes general,
addressed to Ormazd and the Amesha Spentas in common, sometimes
special, containing the praises of a particular deity. The Homa ceremony
consisted in the extraction of the juice of the Homa plant by the
priests during the recitation of prayers, the formal presentation of
the liquor extracted to the sacrificial fire, the consumption of a small
portion of it by one of the officiating priests, and the division of
the remainder among the worshippers. As the juice was drunk immediately
after extraction and before fermentation had set in, it was not
intoxicating. The ceremony seems to have been regarded, in part,
as having a mystic force, securing the favor of heaven; in part, as
exerting a beneficial effect upon the body of the worshipper through the
curative power inherent in the Homa plant. The animals which might be
sacrificed were the horse, the ox, the sheep, and the goat, the horse
being the favorite victim. A priest always performed the sacrifice,
slaying the animal, and showing the flesh to the sacred fire by way of
consecration, after which it was eaten at a solemn feast by the priest
and people.
</p>
<p>
It is one of the chief peculiarities of Zoroastrianism that it regarded
agriculture as a religious duty. Man had been placed upon the earth
especially "to maintain the good creation," and resist the endeavors of
Ahriman to injure, and if possible, ruin it. This could only be done
by careful tilling of the soil, eradication of thorns and weeds, and
reclamation of the tracts over which Ahriman had spread the curse of
barrenness. To cultivate the soil was thus incumbent upon all men;
the whole community was required to be agricultural; and either as
proprietor, as farmer, or as laboring man, each Zoroastrian was bound to
"further the works of life" by advancing tillage.
</p>
<p>
The purity which was required of the Zoroastrian was of two kinds, moral
and legal, Moral purity comprised all that Christianity includes
under it&mdash;truth, justice, chastity, and general sinlessness. It was
coextensive with the whole sphere of human activity, embracing not only
words and acts, but even the secret thoughts of the heart. Legal purity
was to be obtained only by the observance of a multitude of trifling
ceremonies and the abstinence from ten thousand acts in their nature
wholly indifferent. Especially, everything was to be avoided which
could be thought to pollute the four elements&mdash;all of them sacred to the
Zoroastrian of Sassanian times&mdash;fire, water, earth, and air.
</p>
<p>
Man's struggle after holiness and purity was sustained in the
Zoroastrian system by the confident hope of a futurity of happiness.
It was taught that the soul of man was immortal, and would continue to
possess for ever a separate conscious existence. Immediately after death
the spirits of both good and bad had to proceed along an appointed path
to "the bridge of the gatherer" (<i>chinvat peretu</i>). This was a narrow
road conducting to heaven or paradise, over which the souls of the pious
alone could pass, while the wicked fell from it into the gulf below,
where they found themselves in the place of punishment. The steps of
the good were guided and supported by the angel Serosh&mdash;the "happy,
well-formed, swift, tall Serosh"&mdash;who conducted them across the
difficult passage into the heavenly region. There Bahman, rising from
his throne, greeted them on their entrance with the salutation, "Happy
thou who art come here to us from the mortality to the immortality!"
Then they proceeded joyfully onward to the presence of Ormazd, to the
immortal saints, to the golden throne, to paradise. As for the wicked,
when they fell into the gulf, they found themselves in outer darkness,
in the kingdom of Ahriman, where they were forced to remain and to feed
on poisoned banquets.
</p>
<p>
The priests of the Zoroastrians, from a time not long subsequent to
Darius Hystaspis, were the Magi. This tribe, or caste, originally
perhaps external to Zoroastrianism, had come to be recognized as a true
priestly order; and was intrusted by the Sassanian princes with the
whole control and direction of the religion of the state. Its chief was
a personage holding a rank but very little inferior to the king. He bore
the title of Tenpet, "Head of the Religion," or <i>Movpetan Movpet</i>, "Head
of the Chief Magi." In times of difficulty and danger he was sometimes
called upon to conduct a revolution; and in the ordinary course of
things he was always reckoned among the monarch's chief counsellors.
Next in rank to him were a number of <i>Movpets</i>, or "Chief Magi," called
also <i>destoors</i> or "rulers," who scarcely perhaps constituted an order,
but still held an exalted position. Under these were, finally, a large
body of ordinary Magi, dispersed throughout the empire, but especially
congregated in the chief towns.
</p>
<p>
The Magi officiated in a peculiar dress. This consisted of a tall peaked
cap of felt or some similar material, having deep lappets at the side,
which concealed the jaw and even the lips, and a long white robe, or
cloak, descending to the ankles. They assembled often in large numbers,
and marched in stately processions, impressing the multitude by a grand
and striking ceremonial. Besides the offerings which were lavished upon
them by the faithful, they possessed considerable endowments in land,
which furnished them with an assured subsistence. They were allowed by
Chosroes the First a certain administrative power in civil matters; the
collection of the revenue was to take place under their supervision;
they were empowered to interfere in cases of oppression, and protect the
subject against the tax-gatherer.
</p>
<p>
The Zoroastrian worship was intimately connected with fire-temples
and fire-altars. A fire-temple was maintained in every important city
throughout the empire; and in these a sacred flame, believed to have
been lighted from heaven, was kept up perpetually, by the care of the
priests, and was spoken of as "unextinguishable." Fire-altars probably
also existed, independently of temples; and an erection of this kind
maintained from first to last an honorable position on the Sassanian
coins, being the main impress upon the reverse. It was represented with
the flame rising from it, and sometimes with a head in the flame; its
stem was ornamented with garlands or fillets; and on either side, as
protectors or as worshippers, were represented two figures, sometimes
watching the flame, sometimes turned from it, guarding it apparently
from external enemies.
</p>
<p>
Besides the sacerdotal, the Magi claimed to exercise the prophetical
office. From a very early date they had made themselves conspicuous as
omen-readers and dream-expounders; but, not content with such occasional
exhibitions of prophetic power, they ultimately reduced divination to
a system, and, by the help of the barsom or bundle of divining rods,
undertook to return a true answer on all points connected with the
future, upon which they might be consulted. Credulity is never wanting
among Orientals; and the power of the priesthood was no doubt greatly
increased by a pretension which was easily made, readily believed, and
not generally discredited by failures, however numerous.
</p>
<p>
The Magian priest was commonly seen with the barsom in his hand; but
occasionally he exchanged that instrument for another, known as the
<i>khrafgihraghna</i>. It was among the duties of the pious Zoroastrian, and
more especially of those who were entrusted with the priestly office,
to wage perpetual war with Ahriman, and to destroy his works whenever
opportunity offered. Now among these, constituting a portion of "the bad
creation," were all such animals as frogs, toads, snakes, newts, mice,
lizards, flies, and the like. The Magi took every opportunity of killing
such creatures; and the <i>Jchrafgthraghna</i> was an implement which they
invented for the sake of carrying out this pious purpose.
</p>
<p>
The court of the Sassanian kings, especially in the later period of
the empire, was arranged upon a scale of almost unexampled grandeur
and magnificence. The robes worn by the Great King were beautifully
embroidered, and covered with gems and pearls, which in some
representations may be counted by hundreds. <a href="#image-0026">[PLATE XLV.]</a> The royal
crown, which could not be worn, but was hung from the ceiling by a gold
chain exactly over the head of the king when he took his seat in his
throne-room, is said to have been adorned with a thousand pearls, each
as large as an egg. The throne itself was of gold, and was supported on
four feet, each formed of a single enormous ruby. The great throne-room
was ornamented with enormous columns of silver, between which were
hangings of rich silk or brocade. The vaulted roof presented to the
eye representations of the heavenly bodies, the sun, the moon, and the
stars;no while globes, probably of crystal, or of burnished metal, hung
suspended from it at various heights, lighting up the dark space as with
a thousand lustres.
</p>

</center>

<p>
The state observed at the court resembled that of the most formal and
stately of the Oriental monarchies. The courtiers were organized in
seven ranks. Foremost came the Ministers of the crown; next the Mobeds,
or chief Magi; after them, the hirbeds, or judges; then the sipehbeds,
or commanders-in chief, of whom there were commonly four; last of all
the singers, musicians, and men of science, arranged in three orders.
The king sat apart even from the highest nobles, who, unless summoned,
might not approach nearer than thirty feet from him.
</p>
<p>
A low curtain separated him from them, which was under the charge of an
officer, who drew it for those only with whom the king had expressed a
desire to converse.
</p>
<p>
An important part of the palace was the seraglio. The polygamy practised
by the Sassanian princes was on the largest scale that has ever been
heard of, Chosroes II. having maintained, we are told, three thousand
concubines. The modest requirements of so many secondary wives
necessitated the lodging and sustenance of twelve thousand additional
females, chiefly slaves, whose office was to attend on these royal
favorites, attire them, and obey their behests. Eunuchs are not
mentioned as employed to any large extent; but in the sculptures of
the early princes they seem to be represented as holding offices of
importance, and the analogy of Oriental courts does not allow us to
doubt that the seraglio was, to some extent at any rate, under their
superintendence. Each Sassanian monarch had one sultana or principal
wife, who was generally a princess by birth, but might legally be of
any origin. In one or two instances the monarch sets the effigy of his
principal wife upon his coins; but this is unusual, and when, towards
the close of the empire, females were allowed to ascend the throne, it
is thought that they refrained from parading themselves in this way, and
stamped their coins with the head of a male.
</p>
<p>
In attendance upon the monarch were usually his parasol-bearer, his
fan-bearer, who appears to have been a eunuch, the <i>Senelcapan,</i> or
"Lord Chamberlain," the <i>Maypet</i>, or "Chief Butler," the Andertzapet,
or "Master of the Wardrobe," the <i>Alchorapet</i>, or "Master of the
Horse," the <i>Taharhapet</i> or "Chief Cupbearer," the <i>Shahpan</i>, or "Chief
Falconer," and the __Krhogpet, or "Master of the Workmen." Except
the parasol-bearer and fan-bearer, these officials all presided over
departments, and had under them a numerous body of subordinates. If the
royal stables contained even 8000 horses, which one monarch is said to
have kept for his own riding, the grooms and stable-boys must have been
counted by hundreds; and an equal or greater number of attendants must
have been required for the camels and elephants, which are estimated
m respectively at 1200 and 12,000. The "workmen" were also probably
a corps of considerable size, continually engaged in repairs or in
temporary or permanent erections.
</p>
<p>
Other great officials, corresponding more nearly to the "Ministers" of
a modern sovereign, were the <i>Vzourkhramanatar</i>, or "Grand Keeper of the
Royal Orders," who held the post now known as that of <i>Grand Vizier</i>;
the <i>Dprapet Ariats</i>, or "Chief of the Scribes of Iran," a sort of
Chancellor; the <i>Hazarapet dran Ariats</i>, or "Chiliarch of the Gate
of Iran," a principal Minister; the <i>Hamarakar</i>, a "Chief Cashier" or
"Paymaster;" and the <i>Khohrdean dpir</i>, or "Secretary of Council," a sort
of Privy Council clerk or registrar. The native names of these officers
are known to us chiefly through the Armenian writers of the fifth and
seventh centuries.
</p>
<p>
The Sassanian court, though generally held at Ctesiphon, migrated to
other cities, if the king so pleased, and is found established, at
one time in the old Persian capital, Persepolis, at another in the
comparatively modern city of Dastaghord. The monarchs maintained from
first to last numerous palaces, which they visited at their pleasure and
made their residence for a longer or a shorter period. Four such palaces
have been already described; and there is reason to believe that many
others existed in various parts of the empire. There was certainly one
of great magnificence at Canzaca; and several are mentioned as occupied
by Heraclius in the country between the Lower Zab and Ctesiphon.
Chosroes II. undoubtedly built one near Takht-i-Bostan; and Sapor the
First must have had one at Shapur, where he set up the greater portion
of his monuments. The discovery of the Mashita palace, in a position
so little inviting as the land of Moab, seems to imply a very general
establishment of royal residences in the remote provinces of the empire.
</p>
<p>
The costume of the later Persians is known to us chiefly from the
representations of the kings, on whose figures alone have the native
artists bestowed much attention. In peace, the monarch seems to have
worn a sort of pelisse or long coat, partially open in front, and with
close-fitting sleeves reaching to the wrist, under which he had a pair
of loose trousers descending to the feet and sometimes even covering
them. A belt or girdle encircled his waist. His feet were encased in
patterned shoes, tied with long flowing ribbons. Over his pelisse he
wore occasionally a long cape or short cloak, which was fastened with
a brooch or strings across the breast and flowed over the back and
shoulders. The material composing the cloak was in general exceedingly
light and flimsy. The head-dress commonly worn seems to have been
a round cap, which was perhaps ornamented with jewels. The vest and
trousers were also in some cases richly jewelled. Every king wore
ear-rings, with one, two, or three pendants. A collar or necklace was
also commonly worn round the neck; and this had sometimes two or more
pendants in front. Occasionally the beard was brought to a point and had
a jewel hanging from it. The hair seems always to have been worn long;
it was elaborately curled, and hung down on either shoulder in numerous
ringlets. When the monarch rode out in state, an attendant held the
royal parasol over him.
</p>
<p>
In war the monarch encased the upper part of his person in a coat of
mail, composed of scales or links. Over this he wore three belts; the
first, which crossed the breast diagonally, was probably attached to his
shield, which might be hung from it; the second supported his sword;
and the third his quiver, and perhaps his bow-case. A stiff, embroidered
trouser of great fulness protected the leg, while the head was guarded
by a helmet, and a vizor of chain mail hid all the face but the eyes.
The head and fore-quarters of the royal charger were also covered with
armor, which descended below the animal's knees in front, but was not
carried back behind the rider. The monarch's shield was round, and
carried on the left arm; his main offensive weapon was a heavy spear,
which he brandished in his right hand.
</p>
<p>
One of the favorite pastimes of the kings was hunting. The Sassanian
remains show us the royal sportsmen engaged in the pursuit of the
stag, the wild boar, the ibex, the antelope, and the buffalo. To this
catalogue of their beasts of chase the classical writers add the lion,
the tiger, the wild ass, and the bear. Lions, tigers, bears, and wild
asses were, it appears, collected for the purpose of sport, and kept in
royal parks or paradises until a hunt was determined on. The monarchs
then engaged in the sport in person, either singly or in conjunction
with a royal ambassador, or perhaps of a favorite minister, or a few
friends. The lion was engaged hand to hand with sword or spear; the more
dangerous tiger was attacked from a distance with arrows. Stags and
wild boars were sufficiently abundant to make the keeping of them in
paradises unnecessary. When the king desired to hunt them, it was only
requisite to beat a certain extent of country in order to make sure of
finding the game. This appears to have been done generally by elephants,
which entered the marshes or the woodlands, and, spreading themselves
wide, drove the animals before them towards an enclosed space,
surrounded by a net or a fence, where the king was stationed with his
friends and attendants. If the tract was a marsh, the monarch occupied
a boat, from which he quietly took aim at the beasts that came within
shot. Otherwise he pursued the game on horseback, and transfixed it
while riding at full speed. In either case he seems to have joined to
the pleasures of the chase the delights of music. Bands of harpers and
other musicians were placed near him within the enclosure, and he could
listen to their strains while he took his pastime.
</p>
<p>
The musical instruments which appear distinctly on the Sassanian
sculptures are the harp, the horn, the drum, and the flute or pipe. The
harp is triangular, and has seven strings; it is held in the lap, and
played apparently by both hands. The drum is of small size. The horns
and pipes are too rudely represented for their exact character to be
apparent. Concerted pieces seem to have been sometimes played by harpers
only, of whom as many as ten or twelve joined in the execution. Mixed
bands were more numerous. In one instance the number of performers
amounts to twenty-six, of whom seven play the harp, an equal number
the flute or pipe, three the horn, one the drum, while eight are too
slightly rendered for their instruments to be recognized. A portion of
the musicians occupy an elevated orchestra, to which there is access by a
flight of steps.
</p>
<p>
There is reason to believe that the Sassanian monarchs took a pleasure
also in the pastime of hawking. It has been already noticed that among
the officers of the court was a "Head Falconer," who must have presided
over this species of sport. Hawking was of great antiquity in the East,
and appears to have been handed down uninterruptedly from remote times
to the present day. We may reasonably conjecture that the ostriches and
pheasants, if not the peacocks also, kept in the royal preserves, were
intended to be used in this pastime, the hawks being flown at them if
other game proved to be scarce.
</p>
<p>
The monarchs also occasionally amused themselves in their leisure hours
by games. The introduction of chess from India by the great Chosroes
(Anushirwan) has already been noticed; and some authorities state
that the same monarch brought into use also a species of tric-trac or
draughts. Unfortunately we have no materials for determining the exact
form of the game in either case, the Sassanian remains containing no
representation of such trivial matters.
</p>
<p>
In the character of their warfare, the Persians of the Sassanian period
did not greatly differ from the same people under the Achaemenian kings.
The principal changes which time had brought about were an almost entire
disuse of the war chariot, <a href="#image-0027">[PLATE XLVI. Fig. 3.]</a> and the advance of the
elephant corps into a very prominent and important position. Four main
arms of the service were recognized, each standing on a different level:
viz. the elephants, the horse, the archers, and the ordinary footmen.
The elephant corps held the first position. It was recruited from India,
but was at no time very numerous. Great store was set by it; and in some
of the earlier battles against the Arabs the victory was regarded as
gained mainly by this arm of the service. It acted with best effect in
an open and level district; but the value put upon it was such that,
however rough, mountainous, and woody the country into which the Persian
arms penetrated, the elephant always accompanied the march of the
Persian troops, and care was taken to make roads by which it could
travel. The elephant corps was under a special chief, known as the
<i>Zend-hapet</i>, or "Commander of the Indians," either because the beasts
came from that country, or because they were managed by natives of
Hindustan.

</center>

<p>
The Persian cavalry in the Sassanian period seems to have been almost
entirely of the heavy kind. <a href="#image-0027">[PLATE XLVI., Fig. 4.]</a> We hear nothing
during these centuries of those clouds of light horse which, under the
earlier Persian and under the Parthian monarchy, hung about invading or
retreating armies, countless in their numbers, agile in their movements,
a terrible annoyance at the best of times, and a fearful peril under
certain circumstances. The Persian troops which pursued Julian were
composed of heavily armed cavalry, foot archers, and elephants; and
the only light horse of which we have any mention during the disastrous
retreat of his army are the Saracenic allies of Sapor. In these
auxiliaries, and in the Cadusians from the Caspian region, the Persians
had always, when they wished it, a cavalry excellently suited for light
service; but their own horse during the Sassanian period seems to have
been entirely of the heavy kind, armed and equipped, that is, very much
as Chosroes II. is seen to bo at Takht-i-Bostan. The horses themselves
wore heavily armored about their head, neck, and chest; the rider wore a
coat of mail which completely covered his body as far as the hips, and a
strong helmet, with a vizor, which left no part of the face exposed but
the eyes. He carried a small round shield on his left arm, and had for
weapons a heavy spear, a sword, and a bow and arrows. He did not fear a
collision with the best Roman troops. The Sassanian horse often charged
the infantry of the legions with success, and drove it headlong from
the field of battle. In time of peace, the royal guards were more simply
accoutred. [See PLATE XLVI.]
</p>
<p>
The archers formed the elite of the Persian infantry. They were trained
to deliver their arrows with extreme rapidity, and with an aim that was
almost unerring. The huge wattled shields, adopted by the Achaemenian
Persians from the Assyrians, still remained in use; and from behind a
row of these, rested upon the ground and forming a sort of loop-holed
wall, the Sassanian bowmen shot their weapons with great effect; nor
was it until their store of arrows was exhausted that the Romans,
ordinarily, felt themselves upon even terms with their enemy. Sometimes
the archers, instead of thus fighting in line, were intermixed with the
heavy horse, with which it was not difficult for them to keep pace. They
galled the foe with their constant discharges from between the ranks
of the horsemen, remaining themselves in comparative security, as the
legions rarely ventured to charge the Persian mailed cavalry. If they
were forced to retreat, they still shot backwards as they fled; and it
was a proverbial saying with the Romans that they were then especially
formidable.
</p>
<p>
The ordinary footmen seem to have been armed with swords and spears,
perhaps also with darts. They were generally stationed behind the
archers, who, however, retired through their ranks when close fighting
began. They had little defensive armor; but still seem to have fought
with spirit and tenacity, being a fair match for the legionaries under
ordinary circumstances, and superior to most other adversaries.
</p>
<p>
It is uncertain how the various arms of the service were organized
internally. We do not hear of any divisions corresponding to the Roman
legions or to modern regiments; yet it is difficult to suppose that
there were not some such bodies. Perhaps each satrap of a province
commanded the troops raised within his government, taking the actual
lead of the cavalry or the infantry at his discretion. The Crown
doubtless appointed the commanders-in-chief&mdash;the <i>Sparapets, Spaha-pets,
or Sipehbeds</i>, as well as the other generals (<i>arzbeds</i>), the head of
the commissariat (<i>hambarapet</i> or <i>hambarahapet</i>), and the commander of
the elephants (<i>zendkapet</i>). The satraps may have acted as colonels of
regiments under the arzbeds, and may probably have had the nomination of
the subordinate (regimental) officers.

The great national standard was the famous "leathern apron of the
blacksmith," originally unadorned, but ultimately covered with jewels,
which has been described in a former chapter. This precious palladium
was, however, but rarely used, its place being supplied for the most
part by standards of a more ordinary character. These appear by the
monuments to have been of two kinds. Both consisted primarily of a pole
and a cross-bar; but in the one kind the crossbar sustained a single
ring with a bar athwart it, while below depended two woolly tassels; in
the other, three striated balls rose from the cross-bar, while below the
place of the tassels was taken by two similar balls. It is difficult to
say what these emblems symbolized, or why they were varied. In both the
representations where they appear the standards accompany cavalry,
so that they cannot reasonably be assigned to different arms of
the service. That the number of standards carried into battle was
considerable may be gathered from the fact that on one occasion, when
the defeat sustained was not very complete, a Persian army left in the
enemy's hands as many as twenty-eight of them.

During the Sassanian period there was nothing very remarkable in the
Persian tactics. The size of armies generally varied from 30,000 to
60,000 men, though sometimes 100,000, and on one occasion as many as
140,000, are said to have been assembled. The bulk of the troops were
footmen, the proportion of the horse probably never equalling one third
of a mixed army. Plundering expeditions were sometimes undertaken
by bodies of horse alone; but serious invasions were seldom or never
attempted unless by a force complete in all arms; comprising, that
is, horse, foot, elephants, and artillery. To attack the Romans to any
purpose, it was always necessary to engage in the siege of towns; and
although, in the earlier period of the Sassanian monarchy, a certain
weakness and inefficiency in respect of sieges manifested itself, yet
ultimately the difficulty was overcome, and the Persian expeditionary
armies, well provided with siege trains, compelled the Roman fortresses
to surrender within a reasonable time. It is remarkable that in the
later period so many fortresses were taken with apparently so little
difficulty&mdash;Daras, Mardin, Amida, Carrhse, Edessa, Hierapolis, Berhasa,
Theodosiopolis, Antioch, Damascus, Jerusalem, Alexandria, Caesaraea
Mazaca, Chalcedon; the siege of none lasting more than a few months, or
costing the assailants very dear. The method used in sieges was to open
trenches at a certain distance from the walls, and to advance along
them under cover of hurdles to the ditch, and fill it up with earth and
fascines. Escalade might then be attempted; or movable towers, armed
with rams or balistae, might be brought up close to the walls, and the
defences battered till a breach was effected. Sometimes mounds were
raised against the walls to a certain height, so that their upper
portion, which was their weakest part, might be attacked, and either
demolished or escaladed. If towns resisted prolonged attacks of this
kind, the siege was turned into a blockade, lines of circumvallation
being drawn round the place, water cut off, and provisions prevented
from entering. Unless a strong relieving army appeared in the field, and
drove off the assailants, this plan was tolerably sure to be successful.

Not much is known of the private life of the later Persians. Besides the
great nobles and court officials, the strength of the nation consisted
in its <i>dilchans</i> or landed proprietors, who for the most part lived on
their estates, seeing after the cultivation of the soil, and employing
thereon the free labor of the peasants. It was from these classes
chiefly that the standing army was recruited, and that great levies
might always be made in time of need. Simple habits appear to have
prevailed among them; polygamy, though lawful, was not greatly in use;
the maxims of Zoroaster, which commanded industry, purity, and piety,
were fairly observed. Women seem not to have been kept in seclusion,
or at any rate not in such seclusion as had been the custom under
the Parthians, and as again became usual under the Arabs. The general
condition of the population was satisfactory. Most of the Sassanian
monarchs seem to have been desirous of governing well; and the system
inaugurated by Anushirwan, and maintained by his successors, secured
the subjects of the Great King from oppression, so far as was possible
without representative government. Provincial rulers were well watched
and well checked; tax-gatherers were prevented from exacting more than
their due by a wholesale dread that their conduct would be reported
and punished; great pains were taken that justice should be honestly
administered; and in all cases where an individual felt aggrieved at
a sentence an appeal lay to the king. On such occasions the cause was
re-tried in open court, at the gate, or in the great square; the king,
the Magi, and the great lords hearing it, while the people were also
present. The entire result seems to have been that, so far as was
possible under a despotism, oppression was prevented, and the ordinary
citizen had rarely any ground for serious complaint.
</p>
<p>
But it was otherwise with the highest class of all. The near relations
of the monarch, the great officers of the court, the generals who
commanded armies, were exposed without defence to the monarch's caprice,
and held their lives and liberties at his pleasure. At a mere word
or sign from him they were arrested, committed to prison, tortured,
blinded, or put to death, no trial being thought necessary where the
king chose to pronounce sentence. The intrinsic evils of despotism thus
showed themselves even under the comparatively mild government of the
Sassanians; but the class exposed to them was a small one, and enjoyed
permanent advantages, which may have been felt as some compensation to
it for its occasional sufferings.
